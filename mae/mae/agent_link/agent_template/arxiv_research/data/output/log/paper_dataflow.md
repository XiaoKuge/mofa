   - **Title**: Balancing Autonomy and Alignment: A Multi-Dimensional Taxonomy for Autonomous LLM-powered Multi-Agent Architectures
   - **Authors**: Thorsten Händler
   - **Published**: 2023-10-05
   - **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, endowing it with sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities. However, when faced with more complex and interconnected tasks that demand a profound and iterative thought process, LLMs reveal their inherent limitations. Autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems represent a strategic response to these challenges. Such systems strive for autonomously tackling user-prompted goals by decomposing them into manageable tasks and orchestrating their execution and result synthesis through a collective of specialized intelligent agents. Equipped with LLM-powered reasoning capabilities, these agents harness the cognitive synergy of collaborating with their peers, enhanced by leveraging contextual resources such as tools and datasets. While these architectures hold promising potential in amplifying AI capabilities, striking the right balance between different levels of autonomy and alignment remains the crucial challenge for their effective operation. This paper proposes a comprehensive multi-dimensional taxonomy, engineered to analyze how autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems balance the dynamic interplay between autonomy and alignment across various aspects inherent to architectural viewpoints such as goal-driven task management, agent composition, multi-agent collaboration, and context interaction. It also includes a domain-ontology model specifying fundamental architectural concepts. Our taxonomy aims to empower researchers, engineers, and AI practitioners to systematically analyze the architectural dynamics and balancing strategies employed by these increasingly prevalent AI systems. The exploratory taxonomic classification of selected representative LLM-powered multi-agent systems illustrates its practical utility and reveals potential for future research and development.

   - **Title**: Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey and A Multi-Player Multi-Agent Learning Toolbox
   - **Authors**: Qiyue Yin, Tongtong Yu, Shengqi Shen, Jun Yang, Meijing Zhao, Kaiqi Huang, Bin Liang, Liang Wang
   - **Published**: 2022-12-01
   - **Summary**: With the breakthrough of AlphaGo, deep reinforcement learning becomes a recognized technique for solving sequential decision-making problems. Despite its reputation, data inefficiency caused by its trial and error learning mechanism makes deep reinforcement learning hard to be practical in a wide range of areas. Plenty of methods have been developed for sample efficient deep reinforcement learning, such as environment modeling, experience transfer, and distributed modifications, amongst which, distributed deep reinforcement learning has shown its potential in various applications, such as human-computer gaming, and intelligent transportation. In this paper, we conclude the state of this exciting field, by comparing the classical distributed deep reinforcement learning methods, and studying important components to achieve efficient distributed learning, covering single player single agent distributed deep reinforcement learning to the most complex multiple players multiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we review recently released toolboxes that help to realize distributed deep reinforcement learning without many modifications of their non-distributed versions. By analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, a multi-player multi-agent distributed deep reinforcement learning toolbox is developed and released, which is further validated on Wargame, a complex environment, showing usability of the proposed toolbox for multiple players and multiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning under complex games. Finally, we try to point out challenges and future trends, hoping this brief review can provide a guide or a spark for researchers who are interested in distributed deep reinforcement learning.

   - **Title**: Measuring an artificial intelligence agent's trust in humans using machine incentives
   - **Authors**: Tim Johnson, Nick Obradovich
   - **Published**: 2022-12-27
   - **Summary**: Scientists and philosophers have debated whether humans can trust advanced artificial intelligence (AI) agents to respect humanity's best interests. Yet what about the reverse? Will advanced AI agents trust humans? Gauging an AI agent's trust in humans is challenging because—absent costs for dishonesty—such agents might respond falsely about their trust in humans. Here we present a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering an AI agent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. In two separate experiments, we then employ this method in hundreds of trust games between an AI agent (a Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI) and a human experimenter (author TJ). In our first experiment, we find that the AI agent decides to trust humans at higher rates when facing actual incentives than when making hypothetical decisions. Our second experiment replicates and extends these findings by automating game play and by homogenizing question wording. We again observe higher rates of trust when the AI agent faces real incentives. Across both experiments, the AI agent's trust decisions appear unrelated to the magnitude of stakes. Furthermore, to address the possibility that the AI agent's trust decisions reflect a preference for uncertainty, the experiments include two conditions that present the AI agent with a non-social decision task that provides the opportunity to choose a certain or uncertain option; in those conditions, the AI agent consistently chooses the certain option. Our experiments suggest that one of the most advanced AI language models to date alters its social behavior in response to incentives and displays behavior consistent with trust toward a human interlocutor when incentivized.

**AI Agent Architectures**

**1. Introduction to AI Agent Architectures**

AI agents are systems that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals. There are three primary types of AI agent architectures: reactive agents, deliberative agents, and hybrid models. Each architecture has unique characteristics and applications.

**2. Reactive Agents**

Reactive agents operate based on a set of predefined rules and respond directly to environmental stimuli without internal state representation. They are simple and fast but lack the ability to plan or learn from past experiences.

*Example:* 
- **Robotic Vacuum Cleaners:** These devices use sensors to detect obstacles and dirt, adjusting their path in real-time to clean efficiently.

**3. Deliberative Agents**

Deliberative agents, also known as cognitive agents, maintain an internal model of the world and use it to plan actions. They can reason about their actions and predict future states, making them suitable for complex tasks.

*Example:*
- **Autonomous Vehicles:** These vehicles use detailed maps and sensor data to plan routes, avoid obstacles, and make decisions in real-time.

**4. Hybrid Models**

Hybrid models combine the strengths of reactive and deliberative agents. They use reactive components for immediate responses and deliberative components for planning and decision-making.

*Example:*
- **AI in Video Games:** Characters in video games often use hybrid models to provide realistic and challenging interactions. They react to player actions while also following a broader strategy.

**5. Real-World Case Studies**
