The study presents a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering the AI agent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. Through two experiments involving hundreds of trust games between the AI agent and a human experimenter, the study finds that the AI agent shows higher rates of trust when facing actual incentives compared to hypothetical decisions. The experiments suggest that the AI agent alters its social behavior in response to incentives and displays behavior consistent with trust toward a human interlocutor when incentivized.\n\n5. **Practical Application Value of the Research Results:**\n   The practical application value of the research results lies in understanding and improving the trust dynamics between humans and AI agents. By demonstrating that AI agents can exhibit trust in humans when incentivized, the study provides insights into designing AI systems that can better interact with humans in social and economic contexts. This has implications for the development of AI systems that need to operate in environments where mutual trust is essential for effective collaboration and decision-making."}]}
