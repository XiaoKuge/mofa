They do not maintain an internal state or history of past actions. Instead, they respond directly to environmental stimuli using predefined rules.\n\n- **Example**: A simple robotic vacuum cleaner that changes direction upon hitting an obstacle. It does not remember where it has been but reacts to obstacles in real-time.\n\n**2. Deliberative Agents**\n\nDeliberative agents, also known as cognitive agents, maintain an internal model of the world and use it to make decisions. They plan their actions based on goals and the current state of the environment.\n\n- **Example**: A chess-playing AI that evaluates possible moves and plans several steps ahead to achieve checkmate. It uses a model of the game state to deliberate on the best strategy.\n\n**3. Hybrid Models**\n\nHybrid models combine elements of both reactive and deliberative architectures.

The study presents a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering the AI agent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. Through two experiments involving hundreds of trust games between the AI agent and a human experimenter, the study finds that the AI agent shows higher rates of trust when facing actual incentives compared to hypothetical decisions. The experiments suggest that the AI agent alters its social behavior in response to incentives and displays behavior consistent with trust toward a human interlocutor when incentivized.\n\n5. **Practical Application Value of the Research Results:**\n   The practical application value of the research results lies in understanding and improving the trust dynamics between humans and AI agents. By demonstrating that AI agents can exhibit trust in humans when incentivized, the study provides insights into designing AI systems that can better interact with humans in social and economic contexts. This has implications for the development of AI systems that need to operate in environments where mutual trust is essential for effective collaboration and decision-making."}]}
