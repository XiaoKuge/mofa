 Apple Intelligence in 5 minutes. It's personal intelligence right where you need it. On your Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Writing tools are an example of the incredible power of Apple Intelligence. Say you're writing an email. You can change the tone to make it sound more friendly, professional, or concise. Another way writing tools can help you is with Proofread. With Proofread, you can nail the grammar, word choice, and sentence structure. And if you've rambled on in your email, bring out the key points and add them as a TLDR. Apple Intelligence is also great when it comes to images. Let's jump in with Genmoji. You want a T-Rex on a surfboard? You've got a T-Rex on a surfboard. Simply type a description of the emoji you want. How about a smiley face with cucumber eyes or something random like a squirrel DJ? And because Apple Intelligence knows who's in your photo library, you can turn your friend V into an astronaut. Next up, image playground. Create awesome images in seconds, like an image of a cat as a chef. Just type rooftop and any other descriptive words. And it generates the image in the middle playground area. Then choose a style, like animation, sketch, or illustration. And it's done. Apple Intelligence also understands who people are in your photo library, so you can create a personalized image of them for their birthday. Or your mom is a superhero. Image One can transform your rough sketch into a polished image. You can use Apple Pencil to circle it. An image one analyzes your sketch in words and creates an image for you, like magic. Siri takes a huge step forward and is now supercharged by Apple Intelligence. And when you talk to Siri, you'll notice this elegant glowing light around the edge of your screen that shows Apple Intelligence working for you. With natural language, you can speak to Siri more naturally, thanks to richer language understanding capabilities. So if you stumble over words, Siri still understands what you're getting at. What's the weather tomorrow morning at Meer Beach? I mean, Meer Woods. The forecast is calling for clear skies in the morning near Meer Woods National Monument. Siri also remembers what you've just been talking about. Create an event for a hike there tomorrow at 9 a.m. Hike is scheduled for 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. on June 11th. Next, personal context draws from your photos, calendar events, messages, and other apps. So let's say your mom is coming to visit. Simply ask. Siri, when is mom's flight landed? And Siri already knows who mom is. And we'll cross reference flight details from an email to give you an up-to-date arrival time. And if you've forgotten what plans you have, you can say, what's our dinner plan? And Siri knows you mean you and your mom, and we'll find that information in a text she sent you. And if you don't want to ask Siri out loud, you can now type to Siri. Just a double tap at the bottom of the screen, and you can quickly and quietly type your Siri request. Because Apple Intelligence is personal, priority notifications show what's important to you by putting the most important ones at the top of the stack. Personal Intelligence can also make you the star in your very own memory movie. It understands who's in your photo library, so you can just ask photos to create a movie about Leo learning to fish. And it'll whip up a film starring Leo, water, fishing rods, and depending on how successful Leo was. A fish? So those are just a few of the ways Apple Intelligence can help you every day. It's super easy to use and gives you peace of mind knowing it's designed with privacy from the ground up. So that's Apple Intelligence. AI for the rest of us.
