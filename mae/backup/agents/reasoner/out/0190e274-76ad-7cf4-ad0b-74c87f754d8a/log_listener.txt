reasoner_result: {'answer': 'Answer: Former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at his rally on July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the shooting incident occurred, leaving at least one attendee dead [citation:2][citation:4]. The shooter was identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, who had visited the rally site twice before the shooting and had pictures of Trump [citation:13]. The U.S. Secret Service is under scrutiny for security flaws that allowed the shooter to fire from a rooftop near the event [citation:6]. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, frustrating the public and fitting a pattern of high-profile assailants with unknown or murky reasons for their actions [citation:8]. President Joe Biden condemned the attack as "sick" and called for unity in the aftermath [citation:15].', 'web_result': '[{"name": "Update on the FBI Investigation of the Attempted Assassination of ...", "url": "https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/update-on-the-fbi-investigation-of-the-attempted-assassination-of-former-president-donald-trump", "snippet": "The FBI continues to investigate the shooting incident at the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, as an assassination attempt on former ..."}, {"name": "Pennsylvania State Police identified Trump shooter as \'suspicious ...", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pennsylvania-state-police-identified-trump-shooter-suspicious-prior-at-rcna163283", "snippet": "The gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump was identified as suspicious before the shooting because he was hanging ..."}, {"name": "July 13, 2024, coverage of the Trump assassination attempt - CNN", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/election-biden-trump-07-13-24/index.html", "snippet": "Former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at his rally Saturday.
