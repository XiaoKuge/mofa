{'Mixture-of-Agents Enhances Large Language Model Capabilities': ['2 Mixture-of-Agents Methodology\nIn this section, we present our proposed methodology for leveraging multiple models to achieve\nboosted performance. We begin by demonstrating that LLMs possess collaborativeness and thus\ncan improve their responses based on the outputs of other models. Following this, we introduce the\nMixture-of-Agents methodology and discuss its design implications.\n2.1 Collaborativeness of LLMs\nWe begin by demonstrating the collaborativeness of LLMs, specifically their ability to generate higher\nquality responses when they can reference outputs from other models. As we have shown in the\nintroduction and Figure 1, many of today‚Äôs available LLMs exhibit this collaborative capability.\nAn important pathway to extract maximum benefits from collaboration of multiple LLMs is to\ncharacterize how different models are good at in various aspects of collaboration. During the\ncollaboration process, we can categorize LLMs into two distinct roles:\nProposers excel at generating useful reference responses for use by other models. While a good\nproposer may not necessarily produce responses with high scores by itself, it should offer more\ncontext and diverse perspectives, ultimately contributing to better final responses when used by an\naggregator.\nAggregators are models proficient in synthesizing responses from other models into a single, high-\nquality output. An effective aggregator should maintain or enhance output quality even when\nintegrating inputs that are of lesser quality than its own.\nSection 3.3 empirically validate the roles of aggregators and proposers. Specifically, we show that\nmany LLMs possess capabilities both as aggregators and proposers, while certain models displayed\nspecialized proficiencies in distinct roles. GPT-4o, Qwen1.5, LLaMA-3 emerged as a versatile model\neffective in both assisting and aggregating tasks. In contrast, WizardLM demonstrated excellent\nperformance as an proposer model but struggled to maintain its effectiveness in aggregating responses\nfrom other models.\nGiven that an aggregator can generate higher-quality responses by building upon outputs from\nother models, we propose further enhancing this collaborative potential by introducing additional\naggregators. One intuitive idea is to replicate the exercise with multiple aggregators ‚Äî initially\nusing several to aggregate better answers and then re-aggregating these aggregated answers. By\nincorporating more aggregators into the process, we can iteratively synthesize and refine the responses,\nleveraging the strengths of multiple models to produce superior outcomes. This leads to the design of\nour proposed Mixture-of-Agents.\n2.2 Mixture-of-Agents\nThe structure of MoA is illustrated in Figure 2. It has llayers and each layer- iconsists of nLLMs,\ndenoted by Ai,1,Ai,2, ...,Ai,n. It is important to note that LLMs can be reused either within the\nsame layer or across different layers. When many LLMs in a layer are identical, this configuration\nleads to a special structure that corresponds to a model generating multiple possibly different outputs\n(due to the stochasticity of temperature sampling). We refer to this setting as single-proposer, where\nonly a sparse subset of models are activated.\nHere, each LLM Ai,jprocesses an input text and generates its continuation. Our method does not\nrequire any fine-tuning and only utilizes the interface of prompting and generation of LLMs. Formally,\ngiven an input prompt x1, the output of i-th MoA layer yican be expressed as follows:\nyi=‚äïn\nj=1[Ai,j(xi)] +x1, xi+1=yi (1)\nwhere +here means concatenation of texts; ‚äïmeans application of the Aggregate-and-Synthesize\nprompt shown in Table 1 to these model outputs.\nIn practice, we do not need to concatenate prompt and all model responses so only one LLM is needed\nto be used in the last layer. Therefore, we use the output of an LLM from the l-th layer ( Al,1(xl)) as\nthe final output and evaluate the metrics based on it.\n3', 'Mixture-of-Agents Enhances Large Language Model\nCapabilities\nJunlin Wang\nDuke University\nTogether AI\njunlin.wang2@duke.eduJue Wang\nTogether AI\njue@together.aiBen Athiwaratkun\nTogether AI\nben@together.ai\nCe Zhang\nUniversity of Chicago\nTogether AI\ncez@uchicago.eduJames Zou\nStanford University\nTogether AI\njamesz@stanford.edu\nAbstract\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial capa-\nbilities in natural language understanding and generation tasks. With the growing\nnumber of LLMs, how to harness the collective expertise of multiple LLMs is an\nexciting open direction. Toward this goal, we propose a new approach that lever-\nages the collective strengths of multiple LLMs through a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA)\nmethodology. In our approach, we construct a layered MoA architecture wherein\neach layer comprises multiple LLM agents. Each agent takes all the outputs from\nagents in the previous layer as auxiliary information in generating its response.\nMoA models achieves state-of-art performance on AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench and\nFLASK, surpassing GPT-4 Omni. For example, our MoA using only open-source\nLLMs is the leader of AlpacaEval 2.0 by a substantial gap, achieving a score of\n65.1% compared to 57.5% by GPT-4 Omni.1\n1 Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Zhang et al., 2022a; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a;\nTeam et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) have significantly advanced the field of natural\nlanguage understanding and generation in recent years. These models are pretrained on vast amounts\nof data and subsequently aligned with human preferences to generate helpful and coherent outputs\n(Ouyang et al., 2022). However, despite the plethora of LLMs and their impressive achievements,\nthey still face inherent constraints on model size and training data. Further scaling up these models is\nexceptionally costly, often requiring extensive retraining on several trillion tokens.\nAt the same time, different LLMs possess unique strengths and specialize in various tasks aspects.\nFor instance, some models excel at complex instruction following (Xu et al., 2023a) while others may\nbe better suited for code generation (Roziere et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024). This diversity in skill sets\namong different LLMs presents an intriguing question: Can we harness the collective expertise of\nmultiple LLMs to create a more capable and robust model?\nOur answer to this question is Yes. We identify an inherent phenomenon we term the collaborativeness\nof LLMs ‚Äî wherein an LLM tends to generate better responses when presented with outputs\nfrom other models, even if these other models are less capable by itself. Figure 1 showcases\nthe LC win rate on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark (Dubois et al., 2024) for 6 popular LLMs.\n1Our code can be found in: https://github.com/togethercomputer/moa .\nPreprint.

This example showcases 4 MoA layers\nwith 3 agents in each layer. The agents here can share the same model.\nFigure 1: AlpacaEval 2.0 LC win rates im-\nprove when provided with responses from\nother models.When these models are provided with answers gen-\nerated independently by these models, their LC win\nrates significantly improve. This indicates that the\ncollaborativeness phenomenon is widespread among\nLLMs. Remarkably, this improvement occurs even\nwhen the auxiliary responses provided by the other\nmodels are of lower quality than what an individual\nLLM could generate independently.\nBased on this finding, this paper introduces a Mixture-\nof-Agents (MoA) methodology that leverages multi-\nple LLMs to iteratively enhance the generation qual-\nity. The structure of MoA is illustrated in Figure 2.\nInitially, LLMs in the first layer, denoted as agents\nA1,1, ...A 1,nindependently generate responses to a\ngiven prompt. These responses are then presented\nto agents in the next layer A2,1, ...A 2,n(which may reuse a model from the first layer) for further\nrefinement. This iterative refinement process continues for several cycles until obtaining a more\nrobust and comprehensive response.\nTo ensure effective collaboration among models and improve overall response quality, careful\nselection of LLMs for each MoA layer is crucial. This selection process is guided by two primary\ncriteria: (a) Performance Metrics: The average win rate of models in layer iplays a significant role in\ndetermining their suitability for inclusion in layer i+ 1. Therefore, selecting models based on their\ndemonstrated performance metrics ensures higher-quality outputs. (b) Diversity Considerations: The\ndiversity of model outputs is also crucial. Responses generated by heterogeneous models contribute\nsignificantly more than those produced by the same model as we show later in section 3.3. By\nleveraging these criteria ‚Äî performance and diversity ‚Äî MoA aims to mitigate individual model\ndeficiencies and enhance overall response quality through collaborative synthesis.\nWe conduct comprehensive evaluations using AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), FLASK\n(Ye et al., 2023) benchmarks for assessing the response quality across various dimensions. The results\ndemonstrate substantial improvements with our proposed method, achieving a new SOTA win rate of\n65.8% on AlpacaEval 2.0 compared to the previous best of 57.5% achieved by GPT-4 Omni.\nThe contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (1) Novel framework : we propose\na Mixture-of-Agents framework designed to leverage the strengths of multiple LLMs, thereby\nimproving their reasoning and language generation capabilities. (2) Finding of collaborativeness\nof language models : we highlight the inherit collaborativeness among LLMs, where models tend\nto generate better quality responses when they have access to outputs from other models, even if\nthose outputs are of lower quality. (3) State-of-the-art LLM performance : we conducted extensive\nexperiments using multiple highly-competitive benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and\nFLASK; our MoA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.\n2']}
