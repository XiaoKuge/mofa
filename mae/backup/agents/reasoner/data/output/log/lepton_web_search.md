# Answer

Answer: Former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at his rally on July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the shooting incident occurred, leaving at least one attendee dead [citation:2][citation:4]. The shooter was identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, who visited the rally site twice before the shooting and had pictures of Trump [citation:13]. The U.S. Secret Service is under scrutiny for security flaws that allowed the shooter to fire from a rooftop near the event [citation:6]. Trump was injured but deemed 'fine' after the incident [citation:5]. The motive behind the attack remains unclear, frustrating the public and fitting a pattern of high-profile assailants with unknown or murky reasons [citation:9]. Witnesses described the chaos that unfolded during the shooting incident at the rally [citation:10]. The event raised questions about security lapses and the handling of warnings about the gunman by the Secret Service [citation:15]. President Joe Biden condemned the attack as "sick" and called for unity following the incident [citation:16].
