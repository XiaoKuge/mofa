**Language**
- [中文](README_zh.md)

## Use Cases

### 1. [snake_game_build_by_dspy.yml](use_case%2Fsnake_game_build_by_dspy.yml)
This case is a programming task that requires using Python to create a classic snake game.

### 2. [phrase_spelling_error_by_dspy.yml](use_case%2Fphrase_spelling_error_by_dspy.yml)
This case is a sentence error detection task, testing whether the large model can understand the meaning of the sentence and provide the correct sentence.

### 3. [summarize_pdf_by_rag_dspy.yml](use_case%2Fsummarize_pdf_by_rag_dspy.yml)
1. Use dspy, embedding, and vectors to implement the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) function.
2. Vectorize the PDF content and store the vectorized content.
3. Analyze the user's task, extract keywords and content, and query using RAG.
4. The LLM combines the results generated by RAG to complete the task.

### 4. [summarize_pdf_by_crewai_rag.yml](use_case%2Fsummarize_pdf_by_crewai_rag.yml)
1. Use Crewai's tool to implement the RAG function.
2. Define the RAG logic in the agent's prompt (consistent with the query logic in `summarize_pdf_by_rag_dspy.yml`).
3. Crewai will automatically call different tools to implement the logic defined in the prompt.
