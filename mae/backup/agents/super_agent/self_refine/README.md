### Super Agent Example
Below is an example where we use multiple small Reasoner-Agents to achieve a Self-Refine Super-Agent.

### 1. Process Description:
use_case: [self_refine_super_agent](self_refine_super_agent.yml)
1. [writer_agent](use_case%2Fwriter_agent.yml): Responsible for using Reasoner-Agents based on the task, then calling the LLM to generate the results.
2. [feedback_agent](use_case%2Ffeedback_agent.yml): Responsible for providing suggestions on the results based on the problem and the results generated by the `writer_agent`.
3. [refinement_agent](use_case%2Frefinement_agent.yml): Based on the problem, results, and the feedback from the `feedback_agent`, it uses the LLM to optimize the results according to the suggestions.
4. [evaluation_agent](use_case%2Fevaluation_agent.yml): Evaluates whether the results meet the requirements based on the problem and the results from the `refinement_agent`. If they do, it returns the results. If not, it checks the number of iterations. If the number of iterations reaches a certain threshold, it returns the results; otherwise, it calls the `feedback_agent` again.
