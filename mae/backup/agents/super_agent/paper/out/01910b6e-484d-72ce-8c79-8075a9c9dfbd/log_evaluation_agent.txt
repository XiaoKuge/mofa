Deliberative Agents**\n\nDeliberative agents, also known as cognitive agents, maintain an internal model of the world and use it to plan actions. They can reason about their actions and predict future states, making them more flexible and capable of handling complex tasks.\n\n*Example:*\n- **Autonomous Vehicles:** These vehicles use detailed maps and sensor data to plan routes, avoid obstacles, and make decisions based on predicted traffic conditions.\n\n**3. Hybrid Models**\n\nHybrid models combine the strengths of both reactive and deliberative agents. They use reactive components for immediate responses and deliberative components for planning and decision-making.
