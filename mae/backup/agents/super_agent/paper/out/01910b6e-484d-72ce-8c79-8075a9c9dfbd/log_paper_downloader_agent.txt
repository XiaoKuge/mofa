One of these challenges is that\nthe autonomous agent does not have an accurate model tailored to the specific\nhuman that the autonomous agent is interacting with, which could sometimes\nresult in inefficient human-robot interaction and suboptimal system dynamics.\nDeveloping an online method to enable the autonomous agent to learn information\nabout the human model is therefore an ongoing research goal.

This passive\ndesign, however, only allows the robot to obtain information that the human\nchooses to exhibit, which sometimes doesn't capture the human's full intention.\nIn this work, we present an online optimization-based probing procedure for the\nautonomous agent to clarify its belief about the human model in an active\nmanner.

PERL integrates the strengths of physics-based and data-driven methods\nfor traffic state prediction. PERL contains a physics model and a residual\nlearning model. Its prediction is the sum of the physics model result and a\npredicted residual as a correction to it.

There are many emerging AI risks for humanity,\nsuch as autonomous weapons, automation-spurred job loss, socio-economic\ninequality, bias caused by data and algorithms, privacy violations and\ndeepfakes. Social diversity, equity and inclusion are considered key success\nfactors of AI to mitigate risks, create values and drive social justice.\nSustainability became a broad and complex topic entangled with AI. Many\norganizations (government, corporate, not-for-profits, charities and NGOs) have\ndiversified strategies driving AI for business optimization and\nsocial-and-environmental justice.

### Results for Keywords: "AI Agent Architecture", "Multi-Agent Systems", "Autonomous Agents"
1. **Title**: [From Single Agent to Multi-Agent: Improving Traffic Signal Control](./data/output/arxiv_papers/2406.13693v1.pdf)  
   **Authors**: Maksim Tislenko, Dmitrii Kisilev  
   **Published**: 2024-06-19  
   **Summary**: Due to accelerating urbanization, the importance of solving the signal control problem increases. This paper analyzes various existing methods and suggests options for increasing the number of agents to reduce the average travel time. Experiments were carried out with 2 datasets. The results show that in some cases, the implementation of multiple agents can improve existing methods. For a fine-tuned large language model approach, there is a small enhancement on all metrics.
