Despite the remarkable progress, we notice that existing works are heavily dependent on human-designed frameworks, which greatly limits the functional scope and scalability of agent systems. How to automatically extend the specialized agent to multi-agent systems to improve ta***REMOVED***solving capability still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce EvoAgent, a generic method to automatically extend expert agents to multi-agent systems via the evolutionary algorithm, thereby improving the effectiveness of LLM-based agents in solving tasks. Specifically, we consider the existing agent frameworks as the initial individual and then apply a series of evolutionary operators (e.g., mutation, crossover, selection, etc.) to generate multiple agents with diverse agent settings. EvoAgent can be generalized to any LLM-based agent framework, and can automatically extend the existing agent framework to multi-agent systems without any extra human designs. Experimental results across various tasks have shown that EvoAgent can automatically generate multiple expert agents and significantly enhance the ta***REMOVED***solving capabilities of LLM-based agents."

However, purely real-world or simulation-based experiments cannot be employed to explore such complex interactions due to safety and reliability concerns, respectively. Consequently, this work presents an immersive digital twin framework to explore and experiment with the interaction dynamics between autonomous and non-autonomous traffic participants. Particularly, we employ a mixed-reality human-machine interface to allow human drivers and autonomous agents to observe and interact with each other for testing edge-case scenarios while ensuring safety at all times. To validate the versatility of the proposed framework's modular architecture, we first present a discussion on a set of user experience experiments encompassing 4 different levels of immersion with 4 distinct user interfaces. We then present a case study of uncontrolled intersection traversal to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in validating the interactions of a primary human-driven, autonomous, and connected autonomous vehicle with a secondary semi-autonomous vehicle. The proposed framework has been openly released to guide the future of autonomy-oriented digital twins and research on human-autonomy coexistence."

   - **Example:** A simple robotic vacuum cleaner that changes direction upon hitting an obstacle.

2. **Deliberative Agents:**
   - **Description:** Deliberative agents use symbolic reasoning and planning to make decisions. They maintain an internal model of the world and plan actions to achieve their goals.
   - **Example:** An autonomous vehicle that plans its route based on traffic conditions and road maps.

3. **Hybrid Agents:**
   - **Description:** Hybrid agents combine reactive and deliberative approaches, using both predefined rules and planning mechanisms to make decisions.
   - **Example:** A personal assistant AI that can respond to immediate user commands (reactive) and also schedule tasks based on user preferences and calendar events (deliberative).

4. **Multi-Agent Systems:**
   - **Description:** Multi-agent systems consist of multiple interacting agents that can collaborate or compete to achieve individual or collective goals.
   - **Example:** A swarm of drones working together to perform a search and rescue operation.
