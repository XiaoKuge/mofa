Yet\nwhat about the reverse? Will advanced AI agents trust humans? Gauging an AI\nagent's trust in humans is challenging because--absent costs for\ndishonesty--such agents might respond falsely about their trust in humans. Here\nwe present a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering an AI\nagent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. In two separate experiments,\nwe then employ this method in hundreds of trust games between an AI agent (a\nLarge Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI) and a human experimenter (author TJ).\nIn our first experiment, we find that the AI agent decides to trust humans at\nhigher rates when facing actual incentives than when making hypothetical\ndecisions. Our second experiment replicates and extends these findings by\nautomating game play and by homogenizing question wording. We again observe\nhigher rates of trust when the AI agent faces real incentives. Across both\nexperiments, the AI agent's trust decisions appear unrelated to the magnitude\nof stakes. Furthermore, to address the possibility that the AI agent's trust\ndecisions reflect a preference for uncertainty, the experiments include two\nconditions that present the AI agent with a non-social decision task that\nprovides the opportunity to choose a certain or uncertain option; in those\nconditions, the AI agent consistently chooses the certain option. Our\nexperiments suggest that one of the most advanced AI language models to date\nalters its social behavior in response to incentives and displays behavior\nconsistent with trust toward a human interlocutor when incentivized."}]
