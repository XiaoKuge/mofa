            "summary": "The rise of powerful large language models (LLMs) has spurred a new trend in building LLM-based autonomous agents for solving complex tasks, especially multi-agent systems. Despite the remarkable progress, we notice that existing works are heavily dependent on human-designed frameworks, which greatly limits the functional scope and scalability of agent systems. How to automatically extend the specialized agent to multi-agent systems to improve ta***REMOVED***solving capability still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce EvoAgent, a generic method to automatically extend expert agents to multi-agent systems via the evolutionary algorithm, thereby improving the effectiveness of LLM-based agents in solving tasks. Specifically, we consider the existing agent frameworks as the initial individual and then apply a series of evolutionary operators (e.g., mutation, crossover, selection, etc.) to generate multiple agents with diverse agent settings. EvoAgent can be generalized to any LLM-based agent framework, and can automatically extend the existing agent framework to multi-agent systems without any extra human designs. Experimental results across various tasks have shown that EvoAgent can automatically generate multiple expert agents and significantly enhance the ta***REMOVED***solving capabilities of LLM-based agents."

            "summary": "Societal-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles requires them to coexist with human drivers, necessitating mutual understanding and coordination among these entities. However, purely real-world or simulation-based experiments cannot be employed to explore such complex interactions due to safety and reliability concerns, respectively. Consequently, this work presents an immersive digital twin framework to explore and experiment with the interaction dynamics between autonomous and non-autonomous traffic participants. Particularly, we employ a mixed-reality human-machine interface to allow human drivers and autonomous agents to observe and interact with each other for testing edge-case scenarios while ensuring safety at all times. To validate the versatility of the proposed framework's modular architecture, we first present a discussion on a set of user experience experiments encompassing 4 different levels of immersion with 4 distinct user interfaces. We then present a case study of uncontrolled intersection traversal to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in validating the interactions of a primary human-driven, autonomous, and connected autonomous vehicle with a secondary semi-autonomous vehicle. The proposed framework has been openly released to guide the future of autonomy-oriented digital twins and research on human-autonomy coexistence."

The primary objectives of this work are to a) communicate the current capabilities and limitations of existing AI agent implementations, b) share insights gained from our observations of these systems in action, and c) suggest important considerations for future developments in AI agent design. We achieve this by providing overviews of single-agent and multi-agent architectures, identifying key patterns and divergences in design choices, and evaluating their overall impact on accomplishing a provided goal. Our contribution outlines key themes when selecting an agentic architecture, the impact of leadership on agent systems, agent communication styles, and key phases for planning, execution, and reflection that enable robust AI agent systems."

Previous studies mainly focused on implementing all the reasoning capabilities of AI agents within a single LLM, which often makes the model more complex and also reduces the extensibility of AI agent functionality. In this paper, we propose CACA Agent (Capability Collaboration based AI Agent), using an open architecture inspired by service computing. CACA Agent integrates a set of collaborative capabilities to implement AI Agents, not only reducing the dependence on a single LLM, but also enhancing the extensibility of both the planning abilities and the tools available to AI agents. Utilizing the proposed system, we present a demo to illustrate the operation and the application scenario extension of CACA Agent."
