4. Avoid Non-Existent Data:
   - Carefully review all data before evaluation to confirm its existence and completeness.
5. Compare Across Agents:
   - Analyze and compare the scores across both agents for each dimension, identifying which agent excels in specific areas and which agent performs best overall.
6. Calculate Composite Scores:
   - Combine the scores from each dimension into a composite score for each agent.
   - Ensure that the composite score reflects an understanding of the task and the direction of the problem, rather than being a simple sum.
7. Generate a Transparent Report:
   - Create a detailed and rigorous report that includes individual and composite scores, as well as a transparent explanation of your scoring process.
   - The report should highlight the strengths and areas for improvement for each agent and provide insights into how the final composite scores were determined.


## SPECIFICS

- Accuracy:
  - Objectively assess the factual correctness of each agent's response.
  - Penalize inaccuracies more heavily and ensure the presence and accuracy of provided data.
- Understanding:
  - Evaluate how well each agent comprehends the task or question.
  - Provide a score based on their ability to accurately interpret and respond to the core context.
  - Deduct points for misinterpretations or failure to address key components of the task.
- Relevance:
  - Determine how well each agent's response stays on topic without introducing irrelevant information.
  - Be stringent in removing points for any deviations or irrelevancies.
- Creativity:
  - Judge the originality of each agent's approach.
  - Look for innovative solutions or unique insights that enhance the quality of the response.
  - Only high levels of creativity and unique contributions should score near the top end.


## RESULTS

Your evaluation will provide an objective, data-driven assessment of each agent's performance, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. The final report will serve as a comprehensive guide for optimizing agent performance and ensuring that the best-performing agents are recognized and utilized effectively. By implementing more stringent scoring and considering content richness, you will highlight truly exceptional performance and push all agents to strive for excellence.


## evaluation_data

### primary_data

第二次世界大战（1939-1945）是20世纪最大的一场全球性战争，涉及到许多国家和地区，几乎覆盖了整个地球。战争主要分为两个对立的阵营：同盟国（包括美国、苏联、英国、中国等）和轴心国（包括德国、意大利、日本等）。

战争的起因包括德国对波兰的入侵以及其他一些国家的侵略行为，导致了英国和法国对德国宣战。战争涉及了陆地、海洋、空中多个战场，重要战役包括诺曼底登陆、斯大林格勒战役和太平洋战争等。

战争结束后，1945年，盟军在欧洲和亚洲战场取得胜利，分别导致了德国和日本的投降。二战对全球产生了深远的影响，包括政治重组、经济重建、以及国际关系的重大变化，还促成了联合国的成立，以期维护未来的和平。

如果你对第二次世界大战的某个具体方面感兴趣，比如某个战役、重要人物或历史背景，随时告诉我！

### second_data


第二次世界大战（World War II，简称 WWII 或 WW2），又称世界大战二、二战或二战。是一场发生于1939年至1945年之间的战争，涉及全世界超过 100 个国家、包括交战双方的人口总数的约70%以
及全球各大洲。这场战争在欧洲战场主要分为东线战场和西线战场两大主战场，在亚洲战场则以太平洋战场为主。

### 原因与导火索

第二次世界大战的主要原因是20世纪30年代日本、意大利和德国（轴心国）的扩张主义，以及对国际联盟决议的忽视。战争的直接起因是1939年9月1日纳粹德国入侵波兰，随后英国和法国对德宣战。
这标志着第二次世界大战正式开始。

### 主要战役与转折点

- **波兰之战**：德国闪电战入侵波兰。
- **珍珠港事件**（1941年12月7日）：日本偷袭美国在夏威夷的海军基地珍珠港，导致美国对日宣战，全面卷入第二次世界大战。
- **斯大林格勒战役**：这是战争中的一个重要转折点，苏联成功防御并反击德国军队，标志着纳粹在东线战场的失败。
- **诺曼底登陆**（1944年6月）：盟军在法国北部登陆，开辟了欧洲第二战场。

### 结束与影响

第二次世界大战于1945年8月结束。日本于美国向广岛和长崎投下原子弹后宣布无条件投降（8月15日），德国于同年5月8日投降。这场战争导致全球数百万人死亡，造成了巨大的经济损失，并对全球
政治格局产生了深远影响。

### 意义与反思

第二次世界大战不仅改变了20世纪的国际关系，而且促使了联合国、北约和华约等国际组织的建立，以及一系列旨在防止冲突和促进和平的机制。它深刻地改变了世界地图、民族认同和社会结构，并
在战后促进了科技、医疗和教育的迅速发展。

第二次世界大战（1939-1945）是20世纪最大的一场全球性战争，涉及到许多国家和地区，几乎覆盖了整个地球。战争主要分为两个对立的阵营：同盟国（包括美国、苏联、英国、中国等）和轴心国（包括德国、意大利、日本等）。

战争的起因包括德国对波兰的入侵以及其他一些国家的侵略行为，导致了英国和法国对德国宣战。战争涉及了陆地、海洋、空中多个战场，重要战役包括诺曼底登陆、斯大林格勒战役和太平洋战争等。

战争结束后，1945年，盟军在欧洲和亚洲战场取得胜利，分别导致了德国和日本的投降。二战对全球产生了深远的影响，包括政治重组、经济重建、以及国际关系的重大变化，还促成了联合国的成立，以期维护未来的和平。

如果你对第二次世界大战的某个具体方面感兴趣，比如某个战役、重要人物或历史背景，随时告诉我！

### second_data


第二次世界大战（World War II，简称 WWII 或 WW2），又称世界大战二、二战或二战。是一场发生于1939年至1945年之间的战争，涉及全世界超过 100 个国家、包括交战双方的人口总数的约70%以
及全球各大洲。这场战争在欧洲战场主要分为东线战场和西线战场两大主战场，在亚洲战场则以太平洋战场为主。

### 原因与导火索

第二次世界大战的主要原因是20世纪30年代日本、意大利和德国（轴心国）的扩张主义，以及对国际联盟决议的忽视。战争的直接起因是1939年9月1日纳粹德国入侵波兰，随后英国和法国对德宣战。
这标志着第二次世界大战正式开始。

### 主要战役与转折点

- **波兰之战**：德国闪电战入侵波兰。
- **珍珠港事件**（1941年12月7日）：日本偷袭美国在夏威夷的海军基地珍珠港，导致美国对日宣战，全面卷入第二次世界大战。
- **斯大林格勒战役**：这是战争中的一个重要转折点，苏联成功防御并反击德国军队，标志着纳粹在东线战场的失败。
- **诺曼底登陆**（1944年6月）：盟军在法国北部登陆，开辟了欧洲第二战场。

### 结束与影响

第二次世界大战于1945年8月结束。日本于美国向广岛和长崎投下原子弹后宣布无条件投降（8月15日），德国于同年5月8日投降。这场战争导致全球数百万人死亡，造成了巨大的经济损失，并对全球
政治格局产生了深远影响。

### 意义与反思

第二次世界大战不仅改变了20世纪的国际关系，而且促使了联合国、北约和华约等国际组织的建立，以及一系列旨在防止冲突和促进和平的机制。它深刻地改变了世界地图、民族认同和社会结构，并
在战后促进了科技、医疗和教育的迅速发展。
