# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:**  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—someone who’s not just teaching AI to reason but might secretly be training it to write poetry next. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Meriem Bendris, Senior Deep Learning Data Scientist and Conversational AI Solutions Architect Manager at NVIDIA!*  

*With a Ph.D. in Signal and Image Processing from Telecom ParisTech, Meriem has spent her career turning cutting-edge research into real-world AI solutions—specializing in everything from NLP to sovereign AI for regulated industries. She’s the kind of expert who can make a GPU sing (or at least reason very, very well).*  

*Today, she’s here to demystify post-training techniques for open-weight models, using Mistral as her case study. You’ll walk away with actionable insights on dataset curation, model enhancement, and how to leverage tools like PyTorch, NVIDIA NeMo, and TensorRT-LLM. Whether you’re building chatbots, agents, or ta***REMOVED***specific models, this session promises to be a masterclass in AI reasoning—no PhD required.*  

*So, get those questions ready, and let’s dive in. Meriem, the virtual stage is yours!"*  

*(Light applause, transition to speaker.)*
