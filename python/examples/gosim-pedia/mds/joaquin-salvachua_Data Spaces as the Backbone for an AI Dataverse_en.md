# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## üé§ Host Introduction  
*[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning! It‚Äôs my pleasure to introduce our next speaker‚Äîsomeone who doesn‚Äôt just *talk* about the future of data and AI but is actively *building* it. Please welcome **Dr. Joaqu√≠n Salvachua**, Associate Professor at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid and a leading voice in IoT, digital twins, and‚Äîas we‚Äôll see today‚Äîthe backbone of a trusted AI dataverse.  

With a Ph.D. in Telecommunications, over 1,700 citations to his name, and a seat on the FIWARE Technical Steering Committee, Joaqu√≠n is the kind of expert who makes complex topics like data governance sound *almost* easy. (Key word: *almost*.)  

Today, he‚Äôll unpack how data spaces can power a secure, interoperable AI ecosystem‚Äîtouching on everything from GDPR to the EUNOMIA project‚Äôs groundbreaking work with the MCP protocol. Spoiler: It involves *trust*, but not the kind you can borrow from a coworker and forget to return.  

So, if you‚Äôre ready to dive into the architecture of a distributed, self-sovereign ‚ÄòDataverse,‚Äô this is your session. Joaqu√≠n, the virtual stage is yours‚Äîand audience, don‚Äôt be shy with those questions later!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*
