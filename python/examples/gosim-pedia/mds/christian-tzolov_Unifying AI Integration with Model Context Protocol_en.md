# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:**  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—someone who’s making AI integration in Java look almost as effortless as ordering coffee from a chatbot. Please welcome Christian Tzolov, R&D Software Engineer and Spring AI Lead at Broadcom!  

Christian isn’t just a developer—he’s an open-source powerhouse, an Apache Software Foundation Committer, and the brains behind Spring AI, helping enterprises bridge the gap between traditional systems and cutting-edge AI. When he’s not shaping the future of Java-based AI, you might find him sharing his insights at conferences like Spring I/O or writing papers that make even the most complex AI integrations feel approachable.  

Today, Christian will take us deep into the world of the *Model Context Protocol (MCP)*—a game-changer for standardizing how AI models interact with tools and resources. Expect live coding, architectural wisdom, and a masterclass in building intelligent agents that actually understand context. Whether you're an AI enthusiast or just looking to future-proof your applications, this session promises to be both enlightening and practical.  

So, get those questions ready—Christian’s the kind of expert who makes learning feel like a conversation. Let’s dive in!"*

### Session Details
- **Session Title:** Unifying AI Integration with Model Context Protocol  
- **Date:** May 6, 2025  
- **Time:** 15:40 - 16:20  
- **Session Content:**  
  The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how AI models interact with external tools and resources through a structured client-server architecture, facilitating robust agent development. The engineering community worldwide keeps sharing MCP servers that enable client interactions that open truly remarkable and innovative applications.  

  This talk delves into MCP's core capabilities and how the MCP Java SDK combined with Spring AI MCP can integrate AI with your existing resources and applications.  

  Today's intelligent agents can understand context, guide decisions, and integrate seamlessly with external services. Through live coding and practical examples, we will illustrate how to implement both client and server components. By attending this session, you will gain a practical understanding of MCP's standardized interfaces and architectural best practices, empowering you to build and extend AI-powered applications with agent-like capabilities.  

  Whether you're developing new AI-driven solutions or enhancing existing systems, this talk will equip you with the tools and strategies needed to leverage MCP effectively.
