## üé§ Host Introduction

*"Good morning, everyone! It‚Äôs a pleasure to have you all here today. Now, if you‚Äôve ever tried to untangle a ball of yarn‚Äîor worse, a database schema‚Äîyou know how messy things can get. Fortunately, our next speaker not only thrives in complexity but turns it into something brilliant.*  

*Please welcome **Alexy Khrabrov**, AI Community Architect at Neo4j and a true pioneer in open-source science. With a career spanning quantum computing at IBM, founding the acclaimed *Scale/Data/AI By the Bay* conferences, and now bridging AI with graph databases, Alexy is like a Swiss Army knife of tech innovation‚Äîonly sharper and with better GitHub commits.*  

*Today, he‚Äôll dive into **‚ÄòOAKS: The Open Agentic AI Knowledge Stack‚Äô**‚Äîa framework to supercharge AI agents with structured knowledge. Think of it as giving AI a photographic memory, but with fewer awkward childhood photos and more scalable, open-source magic.*  

*This is a session you won‚Äôt want to miss, so grab your questions (or your coffee) and let‚Äôs give a warm welcome to Alexy Khrabrov!"*
