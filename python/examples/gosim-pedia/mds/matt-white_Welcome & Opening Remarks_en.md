# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Welcome & Opening Remarks with Matt White

## üé§ Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Good morning, everyone! It‚Äôs a pleasure to kick off today‚Äôs session with someone who‚Äôs not just steering the ship of open-source AI but also making sure it sails ethically‚Äîno small feat in an ocean of ones and zeros. Please join me in welcoming Matt White, Executive Director of the PyTorch Foundation and GM of AI at the Linux Foundation.  

Matt‚Äôs career reads like a masterclass in tech leadership‚Äîfrom IBM to Amdocs, and now at the helm of PyTorch, where he‚Äôs championing transparency with frameworks like the Model Openness Framework (because ‚Äòblack box AI‚Äô is so last decade). He‚Äôs also the brains behind the Generative AI Commons, proving that ‚Äòresponsible innovation‚Äô isn‚Äôt an oxymoron.  

Today, he‚Äôll share insights on the future of open-source AI‚Äîwhat‚Äôs next, why it matters, and how we can all contribute. Spoiler: It involves fewer robot uprisings than you might think. So, grab your questions, and let‚Äôs dive in. Matt, the virtual stage is yours!"*  

*(Tone: Professional yet warm, with a sprinkle of dry humor to underscore Matt‚Äôs ethical focus.)*
