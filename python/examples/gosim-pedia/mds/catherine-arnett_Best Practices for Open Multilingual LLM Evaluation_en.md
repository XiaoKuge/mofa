# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Best Practices for Open Multilingual LLM Evaluation

## üé§ Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

*It‚Äôs my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, **Catherine Arnett**, an NLP Researcher at **EleutherAI**‚Äîwhere she‚Äôs basically the multilingual whisperer of language models. When she‚Äôs not untangling the complexities of morphologically rich languages, she‚Äôs collecting awards for her groundbreaking research (seriously, check her CV‚Äîit‚Äôs a trophy case). With a PhD in Linguistics from UC San Diego and a knack for making multilingual NLP both rigorous *and* accessible, Catherine is the person you want answering the question: *‚ÄòHow do we know these models aren‚Äôt just fluent in gibberish?‚Äô*  

*Today, she‚Äôll dive into **‚ÄòBest Practices for Open Multilingual LLM Evaluation‚Äô**‚Äîbecause, let‚Äôs face it, evaluating models in 250 languages isn‚Äôt as simple as Google Translate and a prayer. She‚Äôll unpack why current benchmarks fall short, how to navigate the pitfalls, and where the field urgently needs better tools. Spoiler: If you work with low-resource languages, this talk is your survival guide.*  

*So, get those questions ready‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs about tokenization woes or how to avoid ‚Äòcurse of multilinguality‚Äô bingo. Let‚Äôs give a warm welcome to **Catherine Arnett!***"  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*

- **Time:** 17:00 - 17:20 (CEST)  
- **Content:**  
  *Multilingual language models seem to be getting better, but how do we know? In general, language model evaluation is made more uncertain by automatic evaluations which correlate poorly with human ratings, low-quality datasets, and a lack of reproducibility. But for languages other than high-resource languages like English and Mandarin Chinese, these problems are even more consequential. We provide a set of best practices for using existing evaluations. Given the limited number of evaluations for many languages, we highlight languages and tasks that need more benchmarks and outline key considerations for developing new multilingual benchmarks.*
