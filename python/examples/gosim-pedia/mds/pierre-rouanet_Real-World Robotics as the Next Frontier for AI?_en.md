# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Real-World Robotics as the Next Frontier for AI?

## 🎤 Host Introduction  
**Host:**  
*"Good morning, everyone! It’s a pleasure to have you all here today. Now, if you’ve ever looked at a robot and thought, ‘I could definitely out-wrestle that thing,’ our next speaker might just change your mind—or at least make you reconsider.*  

*Please join me in welcoming **Pierre Rouanet**, Co-Founder and CTO of Pollen Robotics, the brilliant minds behind **Reachy 2**, the open-source humanoid robot that’s making waves in embodied AI. Pierre holds a Ph.D. in AI from INRIA Bordeaux, and before diving into robotics, he was busy making machines smarter—which, let’s be honest, is still more than some of us can say about our Mondays.*  

*Under his leadership, Pollen Robotics was acquired by Hugging Face, proving that AI and robotics really do make the perfect match—kind of like coffee and deadlines. Today, he’s here to explore **‘Real-World Robotics as the Next Frontier for AI,’** where he’ll unpack why teaching robots to move in the real world is harder than it looks (spoiler: it’s not just about avoiding furniture).*  

*We’re in for a fascinating session, so get those questions ready—because if there’s anyone who knows how to bridge the gap between AI and the physical world, it’s Pierre. Let’s give him a warm welcome!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*

  > *"As AI continues to push the boundaries of perception and decision-making, robotics emerges as one of its most exciting and demanding playgrounds. In this talk, we’ll explore how the intersection of machine learning and robotics opens up powerful avenues for interaction, manipulation, and embodied intelligence. We will emphasize the critical role of real-world experimentation and data collection in bridging the gap between simulation and deployment. Interestingly, tasks traditionally viewed as complex, like locomotion, have seen significant progress, while seemingly simple behaviors—such as dexterous manipulation—remain open challenges. By grounding AI systems in physical environments, we gain deeper insight into their capabilities and limitations, and identify new directions for research at the intersection of learning, control, and embodiment."*
