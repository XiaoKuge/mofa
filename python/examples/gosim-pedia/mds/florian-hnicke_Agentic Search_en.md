# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*[With upbeat energy]*  

**"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—Florian Hönicke, Principal AI Engineer at Jina AI and a man who’s probably synthesized more data than most of us have had hot coffees. (And if you’ve ever worked in AI, you know that’s saying something.)**  

Florian’s career reads like a roadmap of AI innovation—from pioneering speech synthesis in the 2010s to now leading the charge in agentic search and synthetic data at Jina AI. He’s not just building the future of search; he’s advising the European Parliament on AI policy, which means he’s literally helping shape the rules of the game.  

Today, he’s here to unravel the magic behind *Agentic Search*—where AI doesn’t just fetch answers but *thinks* about them. Expect a deep dive into how this tech is transforming industries, served with Florian’s signature clarity (and maybe a side of Berliner wit).  

So, if you’ve ever wondered how AI can search smarter—not harder—get those questions ready. Let’s give it up for Florian Hönicke!"*  

*[Lead applause, transition smoothly.]*
