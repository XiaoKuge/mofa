# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: OpenManus Session

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning! It‚Äôs my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Sirui Hong‚ÄîTechnical Leader of NLP/AIGC Algorithms at DeepWisdom and co-founder of OpenManus. Now, if you‚Äôve ever wished your software team could just *automagically* handle tasks, Sirui is the person making that a reality‚Äîwith GPT agents that collaborate better than some humans I‚Äôve worked with!  

With a background from HKUST and a trailblazing career in AI, Sirui has led groundbreaking work on MetaGPT and OpenManus, frameworks that turn LLMs into efficient, multi-agent teams. His research has graced NeurIPS, ICLR, and stages worldwide‚Äîproving that yes, robots *can* play nice together.  

Today, he‚Äôll dive into *OpenManus: Empowering LLM-based Agent Applications*‚Äîshowing us how this lightweight framework supercharges adaptability and scalability for AI workflows. Expect sharp insights, real-world applications, and maybe even a glimpse into the future of autonomous teams.  

So, get those questions ready‚Äîthis is one session you‚Äôll want to engage with. Let‚Äôs give a warm welcome to Sirui Hong!"*
