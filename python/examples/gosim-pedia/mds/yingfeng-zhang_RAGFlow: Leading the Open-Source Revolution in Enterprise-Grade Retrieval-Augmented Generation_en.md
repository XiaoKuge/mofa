# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon! We have a truly exciting session coming up—one that might just change how you think about AI-powered retrieval systems. Please join me in welcoming Yingfeng Zhang, the brilliant Co-Founder and CEO of InfiniFlow. Now, if you’ve ever struggled with getting AI to actually *find* what it’s looking for, Yingfeng is the person who’s been quietly solving that problem while the rest of us were still typing vague queries into chatbots.  

Yingfeng is a pioneer in AI-native databases, blending vector search, tensor search, and good old-fashioned text retrieval into something far smarter. He’s the mind behind InfiniFlow’s groundbreaking work—like the Infinity database and RAGFlow, which are helping enterprises turn messy data into precise, actionable insights. And if you’ve read his thought-provoking articles on the future of vector databases, you’ll know he doesn’t just build solutions; he’s shaping the conversation around them.  

Today, he’s here to talk about *RAGFlow: Leading the Open-Source Revolution in Enterprise-Grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation*. If that sounds like a mouthful, don’t worry—it boils down to this: How do we fix RAG’s stubborn problems (like data quality and semantic gaps) without losing our minds? Spoiler: Open-source innovation is the hero we need. You’ll leave this session with a clearer roadmap for building robust, enterprise-ready AI applications—and maybe a few ‘why didn’t I think of that?’ moments.  

So, grab your questions—whether it’s about hybrid search, multimodal RAG, or how to avoid AI hallucinating its way through your documents—because we’ve got an expert in the room. Let’s give a warm welcome to Yingfeng Zhang!"
