# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction  

**Host:**  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

We have the pleasure of welcoming **Luca Antiga**, the brilliant **CTO of Lightning AI**‚Äîwho, in addition to co-authoring *Deep Learning with PyTorch* (a book many of us probably have on our desks, either well-read or‚Ä¶ optimistically bookmarked), is also a key architect behind PyTorch Lightning. If you‚Äôve ever trained a model without tearing your hair out, you might owe him a coffee.  

With a PhD in Bioengineering and a career spanning from co-founding **Orobix** to shaping PyTorch‚Äôs core, Luca is on a mission to make AI scalable, efficient, and *actually usable*‚Äînot just for researchers, but for anyone brave enough to deploy models in the real world.  

Today, he‚Äôs here to talk about **‚ÄòLightning Thunder: Supercharged PyTorch for Modern Hardware.‚Äô** Because let‚Äôs be honest: modern GPUs are *fast*, but only if you whisper the right incantations to them. Luca will show us how Lightning Thunder takes your ‚Äòeducational-style‚Äô PyTorch code and turns it into optimized, distributed magic‚Äîwithout rewriting a single line. Think of it as a performance turbocharger, but for AI.  

So, whether you‚Äôre tired of GPU waste, obsessed with kernel fusion, or just want to squeeze every FLOP out of your hardware, **you‚Äôre in for a treat**. Get ready to take notes, ask questions, and maybe even rethink your entire stack.  

Please join me in welcoming **Luca Antiga!**"*  

*(Applause, smooth transition to session.)*

## Event and Session Details  

### **Conference Overview**  
- **Name:** GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates:** May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location:** Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme:** Driving Global Open-Source AI Collaboration  
- **Tracks:** AI Model, AI Infra, AI Apps, Embodied AI, PyTorch Day France  

### **Session Details**  
- **Title:** Lightning Thunder: Supercharged PyTorch for Modern Hardware  
- **Date:** May 7, 2025  
- **Time:** 16:20 - 16:40  
- **Content:**  
  Modern GPUs like Hopper and Blackwell are fast, but only after careful optimization. Lightning Thunder compiles ‚Äúeducation-style‚Äù PyTorch models into optimized, distributed PyTorch code. Through a composable plugin system, Lightning Thunder lets developers layer in kernel fusion, low-precision operations, memory optimizations, and flexible parallelism strategies, to achieve performance and scale while leaving the original PyTorch code unchanged. This talk will cover how Lightning Thunder bridges the gap between ease-of-use and peak performance, and enables teams to easily write custom code transformations to scale models efficiently, reduce GPU waste, and stay in control of their stack.
