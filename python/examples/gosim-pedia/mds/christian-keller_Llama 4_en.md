# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Llama 4 - The Next Frontier in Foundation Models

## 🎤 Host Introduction  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

*We are thrilled to introduce our next speaker, Christian Keller—Product Lead for Generative AI Research at Meta and someone who clearly never met a cutting-edge technology he didn’t want to optimize. With an MBA from Stanford, an engineering background that reads like a tech wishlist, and a career spanning AI, biotech, and energy innovation, Christian doesn’t just follow trends—he sets them. (And yes, he’s also collected a few awards along the way, just for fun.)*  

*Today, he’s here to pull back the curtain on **Llama 4**, Meta’s next-generation foundation model. We’re talking long-context wizardry, multimodal mastery, and a deep dive into how this AI could redefine everything from autonomous agents to human collaboration. Spoiler: It’s going to be *mind-bending*.  

*So, whether you’re here for the tech, the vision, or just to witness the future in real time, get ready for an electrifying session. Christian, the virtual stage is yours—let’s Llama-nate this audience!"*  

*(Applause, smooth transition to speaker.)*
