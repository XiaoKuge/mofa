# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Kubetorch Session

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—someone who’s making Kubernetes play nice with ML workflows, which, let’s be honest, is like teaching cats to swim. Please welcome Paul Yang, Engineer at Runhouse and the brains behind Kubetorch—a platform so slick, it might just make MLOps engineers reconsider their life choices.*  

*Paul’s work at Runhouse focuses on turning the chaos of ML infrastructure into something resembling order—bridging Python and Kubernetes with the finesse of a platform engineer who’s seen one too many ‘works on my machine’ incidents. With a background from Princeton and a knack for cutting through ML deployment bottlenecks, he’s on a mission to shrink ‘research-to-production’ timelines from weeks to minutes.*  

*Today, he’ll dive into ‘Kubetorch: A Modern Kubernetes-Native Approach to ML Execution and Production.’ If you’ve ever waited hours to test a tiny model tweak or lost days wrestling with deployment YAMLs, this session is your antidote. Expect insights on making ML infrastructure as iterative as your code—without the usual headaches.*  

*So, grab your questions—or your war stories—and let’s give it up for Paul Yang!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*

## 📅 Event and Session Details  

### Conference Overview  
- **Name:** GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates:** May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location:** Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme:** Driving global open-source AI collaboration across six tracks: AI Model, AI Infra, AI Apps, Embodied AI, AI for Science, and Global Open-Source AI Collaboration.  

### Session Details  
- **Title:** *Kubetorch: A Modern Kubernetes-Native Approach to ML Execution and Production*  
- **Date:** May 7, 2025  
- **Time:** 14:00 - 14:40 (CEST)  
- **Content:**  
  Mature organizations run ML workloads on Kubernetes, but implementations vary widely, and ML engineers rarely enjoy the streamlined development and deployment experiences that platform engineering teams provide for software engineers. Making small changes takes an hour to test and moving from research to production frequently takes multiple weeks – these unergonomic and inefficient processes are unthinkable for software, but standard in ML. Kubetorch is an introduction of a novel compute platform that is Kubernetes-native that offers a great, iterable, and debuggable interface into powerful compute for developers, without introducing new pitfalls of brittle infrastructure or long deployment times.
