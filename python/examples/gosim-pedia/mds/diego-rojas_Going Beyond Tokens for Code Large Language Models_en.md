# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

*Our next speaker is someone who’s clearly cracked the code—both literally and figuratively. Please welcome Diego Rojas, Research Engineer at Zhipu.AI and a driving force behind cutting-edge advancements in large language models for code generation. When he’s not teaching AI to write better code than most of us, he’s contributing to open-source projects like GLM-4 and ChatGLM3—because apparently, free time is just untapped training data.*  

*With a background spanning Tsinghua University, distributed systems, and AIOps, Diego bridges the gap between academic rigor and real-world impact. His work on reinforcement learning for model alignment proves he’s not just building smarter machines—he’s making sure they play nice with humans too.*  

*Today, Diego will take us *beyond tokens*—because why settle for clunky tokenization when you can reimagine LLM architecture entirely? If you’ve ever wondered how to slash latency and boost performance while ditching traditional tokenizers, this is your session. Spoiler: It involves less ‘waiting for the model to think’ and more ‘watching it work like magic.’*  

*So, sharpen your questions—or just your curiosity—and let’s give a warm welcome to Diego Rojas!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*
