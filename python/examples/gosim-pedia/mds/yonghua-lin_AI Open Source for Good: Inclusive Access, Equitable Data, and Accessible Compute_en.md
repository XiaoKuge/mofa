# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: AI Open Source for Good

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*[With upbeat energy]*  
"Good morning, everyone! It’s a pleasure to kick off this session with someone who proves that AI innovation and leadership aren’t just about algorithms—they’re also about vision, collaboration, and, as we’ll hear today, *open doors*. Please join me in welcoming **Yonghua Lin**, Vice President and Chief Engineer at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence—or as I like to call her, the architect of AI’s ‘great equalizer.’  

With a career spanning IBM’s research labs—where she earned the title of Distinguished Engineer—to being named one of *Forbes’* 50 Leading Female Tech Leaders in China, Yonghua has spent decades turning cutting-edge ideas into real-world impact. She’s not just optimizing AI systems; she’s democratizing them, ensuring *everyone*—from students to startups—can access the tools to build the future.  

This morning, she’ll take us inside **‘AI Open Source for Good,’** a mission that’s as bold as it is urgent. Imagine voice datasets designed for underrepresented groups, global data hubs with 680,000 downloads, and software that makes even legacy hardware *sing* with AI potential. Spoiler: This isn’t just theory—it’s already happening.  

So, whether you’re here for the tech, the ethics, or the sheer thrill of AI breaking barriers, get ready for a session that’s equal parts inspiration and action. And don’t be shy—Yonghua’s the kind of speaker who *loves* your questions. Let’s give her a warm welcome!"

## 📅 Event and Session Details  

### **Conference Overview**  
- **Name:** GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates:** May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location:** Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme:** Global Open-Source AI Collaboration  
- **Highlights:** Six tracks covering AI models, infrastructure, applications, embodied AI, and PyTorch advancements.  

### **Session Details**  
- **Title:** *AI Open Source for Good: Inclusive Access, Equitable Data, and Accessible Compute*  
- **Date:** May 6, 2025  
- **Time:** 10:30 - 11:10 (CET)  
- **Content:**  
  This talk unveils how open source technologies act as catalysts for equitable AI across three pillars. First, inclusive access: We open-source voice datasets tailored for underrepresented groups—such as children and the elderly—to ensure multimodal AI systems understand diverse linguistic patterns and bridge generational divides. Second, equitable data: we have released nearly 100 globally accessible datasets, amassing over 680,000 downloads, empowering developers from any countries to innovate freely. Third, accessible compute: We present FlagOS, an open-source system software that facilitates AI development and deployment across diverse hardware ecosystems—including legacy GPUs and emerging accelerators—while significantly lowering the cost barrier to AI innovation. Collectively, these open-source efforts transform 'AI for Good' into a shared mission—breaking barriers of age, location, and resources to empower anyone to create and benefit from AI.
