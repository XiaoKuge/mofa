# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Session with Xiyuan Wang

## Host Introduction
**Host's Introduction:**  

*"Ladies and gentlemen, good [morning/afternoon]! It’s my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, someone who’s clearly mastered the art of making AI run faster than my morning coffee kicks in—please welcome **Xiyuan Wang**, Senior Software Engineer at Huawei and a driving force in open-source AI innovation.  

Xiyuan’s resume reads like a tech enthusiast’s dream: maintainer of **vllm-ascend**, contributor to China’s National AI R&D Program, and an IEEE Senior Member—which, for the uninitiated, is like the tech world’s version of a superhero badge. With stints at Microsoft Research Asia and a degree from UC Berkeley, he’s spent years bridging frameworks like ONNX and Spark to make AI more scalable and, frankly, a little bit magical.  

Today, he’ll dive into *‘The Best Practices of Training and Inferencing on Ascend CANN’*—where he’ll unravel how Huawei’s CANN platform turbocharges AI workflows, from PyTorch to vllm. If you’ve ever wondered how to squeeze every drop of performance from AI processors, this is your session.  

So, grab your questions—and maybe a notebook—because we’re about to learn from an expert who’s turning AI theory into *very* fast practice. Let’s give a warm welcome to Xiyuan Wang!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*
