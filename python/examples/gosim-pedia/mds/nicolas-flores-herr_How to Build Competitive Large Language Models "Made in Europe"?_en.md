# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## üé§ Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

*Our next speaker is someone who proves that brains and ambition can indeed coexist‚Äîthough I suspect his coffee intake might also play a role. Please welcome Dr. Nicolas Flores-Herr, Team Leader for Conversational AI and Head of Foundation Models & Gen AI Systems at Fraunhofer IAIS.*  

*With a background that zigzags from neuroscience‚Äîwhere he studied how our brains process information‚Äîto now leading Europe‚Äôs charge in sovereign AI, Nicolas is the perfect guide to demystify the complexities of multilingual large language models. He‚Äôs the driving force behind OpenGPT-X, a project dedicated to building competitive, open-source LLMs that reflect Europe‚Äôs diverse languages and values‚Äîbecause, as we all know, AI should speak more than just 'Silicon Valley.'*  

*Today, he‚Äôll unpack how Europe is carving its own path in the AI race, from data diversity to ethical transparency. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, policymaker, or just AI-curious, this session promises insights you won‚Äôt want to miss.*  

*So, get those questions ready‚ÄîNicolas is here to share, inspire, and maybe even debunk a myth or two. Let‚Äôs give him a warm welcome!"*  

(*Applause, transition to speaker*)
