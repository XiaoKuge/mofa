# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Harnessing Common Crawl for AI and ML Applications

## üé§ Host Introduction  
*[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon! It‚Äôs a pleasure to have you all here today. Now, if you‚Äôve ever wondered how to wrangle the vast, wild frontier of the internet into something usable for AI‚Äîwell, you‚Äôre in luck, because our next speaker has made a career out of it.*  

*Please welcome **Pedro Ortiz Suarez**, Senior Research Scientist at the Common Crawl Foundation. With a PhD in NLP from Sorbonne Universit√© and a knack for turning web chaos into structured datasets, Pedro has been instrumental in projects like OSCAR, CamemBERT, and BLOOM‚Äîproving that yes, you *can* teach an AI to speak (and maybe even understand) multiple languages.*  

*Today, he‚Äôll be sharing practical strategies for harnessing Common Crawl‚Äôs colossal web archive for AI and ML applications. Expect insights on filtering multilingual data, optimizing pipelines, and even a peek behind the curtain at how URLs earn their spot in the crawl. Spoiler: It‚Äôs not just luck.*  

*So, whether you‚Äôre battling data heterogeneity or just curious about the backbone of open-source AI, this is your session. Questions are encouraged‚Äîbecause if anyone knows how to decode the internet‚Äôs noise into signal, it‚Äôs Pedro. Let‚Äôs give him a warm welcome!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*

### **Session Details**  
- **Title**: *Harnessing Common Crawl for AI and ML Applications*  
- **Date**: May 7, 2025  
- **Time**: 14:20 - 14:40 (CEST)  
- **Content**:  
  This presentation looks at effective strategies for using Common Crawl's web archive in large-scale research applications, specifically for AI and other ML applications. We will discuss practical approaches to processing and filtering Common Crawl‚Äôs datasets, with focus on how to overcome computational challenges and optimise data pipelines. We will also discuss some of the challenges that users might encounter related to the multilingual and heterogeneous nature of Common Crawl‚Äôs data. The talk will cover best practices for data filtering, pre-processing, and storage, to ensure the quality and relevance of extracted information for research tasks. Additionally, we will briefly discuss the ranking mechanism used to determine whether a URL is crawled, and demonstrate how to use the Web Graph as a framework for further research.
