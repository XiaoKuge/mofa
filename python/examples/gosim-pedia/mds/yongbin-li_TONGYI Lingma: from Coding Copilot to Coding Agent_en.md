# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Yongbin Li Session

## 🎤 Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Good morning, everyone! It's a pleasure to have you all here today. Now, let's turn our attention to someone who's not just making AI write code—but making it write *good* code (and maybe even debug it while we take a coffee break). Please join me in welcoming **Yongbin Li**, Senior Algorithm Expert at Alibaba Tongyi Lab!*  

*With over 15 years at Alibaba and a trailblazer in LLMs, Yongbin leads the teams behind game-changers like *Tongyi Lingma*—your soon-to-be favorite coding copilot—and *Tongyi Xingchen*, the AI that lets you role-play as a pirate, a CEO, or, if you're feeling ambitious, both. His work has earned accolades from ACL to NeurIPS, proving that yes, AI can indeed follow complex instructions (unlike some of us after lunch).*  

*Today, he'll take us on a deep dive into *Tongyi Lingma: From Coding Copilot to Coding Agent*, exploring how Code LLMs are reshaping software engineering—from autocomplete to autonomous problem-solving. Expect sharp insights, real-world applications, and perhaps a glimpse into whether AI will replace developers (spoiler: not if you keep asking it to 'explain like I'm five').*  

*So, grab your notebooks—or just open a blank IDE and let Lingma take notes for you. After the talk, we'll have time for your burning questions. Let's give a warm welcome to Yongbin Li!"*
