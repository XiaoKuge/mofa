# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction

**Host:**  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning! It’s a pleasure to welcome you to what promises to be a fascinating session. Our next speaker is someone who clearly believes that robots and distributed systems should work together as smoothly as a well-oiled machine—because if they don’t, well, that’s how you get sci-fi movie plots.*  

*Please welcome Philipp Oppermann, the brilliant mind behind the Dora framework—a middleware designed to make AI-based robotics applications not just functional, but *elegantly* functional. Philipp is a freelance Rust developer with a passion for operating systems and robotics, and if you’ve ever tried to build an OS from scratch (or even thought about it), you might know his widely acclaimed blog series, *‘Writing an OS in Rust’*—which, by the way, is not just informative but also proof that he enjoys a good challenge.*  

*Today, Philipp will take us through *‘Distributed Dataflows in Dora Using Zenoh’*—a session that dives into how Dora enables seamless communication across multiple machines, making complex robotic applications more scalable and efficient. If you’ve ever wondered how to keep your robots from arguing over network bandwidth (because yes, even machines can have communication issues), this talk is for you.*  

*So, get ready for an insightful deep dive, and don’t hesitate to ask questions—after all, the future of intelligent machines is a group project. Please join me in welcoming Philipp Oppermann!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*

## 📅 Event and Session Details  

### **Conference Overview**  
- **Name:** GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates:** May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location:** Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme:** Driving global open-source AI collaboration across six tracks: AI Model, AI Infra, AI Apps, Embodied AI, AI for Science, and Global Open-Source AI Collaboration.  

### **Session Details**  
- **Title:** Distributed Dataflows in Dora Using Zenoh  
- **Date:** May 6, 2025  
- **Time:** 11:10 - 11:50 (CET)  
- **Content:**  
  The Dora framework makes it easy to create dataflows for robotics and AI. In this talk, we look into distributed dataflows that run on multiple machines and communicate through the network. Dora supports complex network topologies by using the Zenoh protocol. This way, it is possible to split Dora dataflows across private networks and cloud machines with minimal configuration.
