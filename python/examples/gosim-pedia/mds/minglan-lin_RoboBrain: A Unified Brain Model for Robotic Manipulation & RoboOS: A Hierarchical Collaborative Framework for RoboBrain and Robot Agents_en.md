# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Embodied AI Track

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—someone who’s quite literally giving robots a brain! Please join me in welcoming Minglan Lin, Embodied Intelligence Researcher at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence.  

Minglan is at the forefront of bridging AI with the physical world, leading groundbreaking projects like RoboBrain—a large model that’s teaching robots to plan, predict, and even collaborate like never before. (Turns out, robots *can* be team players!) Her work on the RoboOS framework is paving the way for smarter, more adaptable robotic systems—because if the future is going to include robot assistants, we’d prefer they don’t, say, accidentally reorganize our kitchens into abstract art.  

Today, she’ll dive into *RoboBrain: A Unified Brain Model for Robotic Manipulation* and *RoboOS*, the hierarchical framework making multi-robot collaboration a reality. Expect insights on how AI is evolving beyond screens and into the world around us—with fewer sci-fi mishaps, hopefully.  

So, if you’ve ever wondered how robots might one day fetch your coffee *without* mistaking the pot for a stress ball, this is your session. Minglan, the virtual stage is yours!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*

## 📅 Event and Session Details

### Conference Overview
- **Event Name**: GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates**: May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location**: Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme**: Driving progress in global open-source AI collaboration  
- **Host**: GOSIM (Global Open-Source Innovation Meetup)  
- **Co-organizer**: CSDN  

### Session Details
- **Title**: *RoboBrain: A Unified Brain Model for Robotic Manipulation & RoboOS: A Hierarchical Collaborative Framework for RoboBrain and Robot Agents*  
- **Date**: May 6, 2025  
- **Time**: 14:40 - 15:20 (CEST)  
- **Content**:  
  RoboBrain is an MLLM-based model that enhances robotic manipulation by integrating task planning, object affordance, and trajectory prediction, addressing the limitations of MLLMs in robotic scenarios—particularly in long-horizon tasks—while achieving state-of-the-art performance. Building on RoboBrain’s planning capabilities, we propose the RoboOS hierarchical collaborative framework, which integrates the efficient execution of the robotic skills to enable cross-embodiment collaborative control of multiple robots.
