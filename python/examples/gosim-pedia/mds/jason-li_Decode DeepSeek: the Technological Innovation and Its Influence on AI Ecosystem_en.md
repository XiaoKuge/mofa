# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction  

*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

*Our next speaker is a true polymath in the world of AI—Jason Li, Senior Vice President at CSDN and a thought leader who’s as comfortable discussing C++ standardization as he is decoding the future of LLMs. When he’s not chairing the ML-Summit or advising ISO committees, he’s probably writing papers with titles so cutting-edge, they sound like sci-fi.*  

*With a career spanning from pioneering open-source education to shaping AI commercialization, Jason has been recognized as a Microsoft MVP and Tencent TVP—*repeatedly*—because apparently, one award just wasn’t enough.*  

*Today, he’ll take us on a deep dive into **‘Decode DeepSeek: The Technological Innovation and Its Influence on the AI Ecosystem.’** We’ll explore everything from paradigm-shifting inference computing to how DeepSeek is rewriting the rules for AI Agents and open-source collaboration. Spoiler: The AI landscape won’t look the same afterward.*  

*So, grab your metaphorical hard hats—this session is where theory meets tectonic shifts. Jason’s insights are gold, and questions are encouraged. Let’s give a warm welcome to Jason Li!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*
