# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

Now, let’s talk about someone who doesn’t just *simulate* innovation—he *engineers* it. Please welcome Sébastien Crozet, CEO and Founder of Dimforge, a man who’s turned Rust into gold with his open-source wizardry. When he’s not collecting GitHub badges like trading cards (*‘Pair Extraordinaire,’ ‘Galaxy Brain’—no big deal*), he’s busy redefining what’s possible in physics simulations and AI.  

**Speaker’s Background:**  
Sébastien’s journey reads like a tech thriller: from R&D engineer crafting advanced algorithms to founding Dimforge, where he’s pioneered game-changing libraries like Rapier and Nalgebra. Oh, and he *also* co-founded a mining software company—because why not disrupt *multiple* industries? His work powers everything from academic research to real-world engineering, proving that Rust isn’t just a language—it’s a superpower.  

**Session Introduction:**  
Today, he’s here to unravel *WGML*—a high-performance, cross-platform LLM inference framework that’s as sleek as it sounds. Ever wanted to build your own low-level LLM library? Sébastien’s got the playbook. We’re talking Rust, WebGPU, and pro tips for squeezing every drop of performance from your models. Spoiler: You’re about to learn from someone who *wrote the manual*—literally.  

**Encourage Engagement:**  
So, flex those question muscles! Whether you’re a Rustacean, a GPU whisperer, or just here for the *aha* moments, this session’s for you. Let’s give a warm welcome to Sébastien Crozet!"
