# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction  
**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

*It’s my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Professor Zijiang James Yang—or as his students probably call him, the 'Maestro of Model Checking.' Currently a Full Professor at the University of Science and Technology of China, James has spent over two decades bridging the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications, from formal verification to autonomous driving. With a PhD from UPenn, a trail of awards (including ACM SIGSOFT’s Outstanding Paper honor), and a knack for making complex systems behave, he’s the kind of expert who can debug a multi-threaded nightmare *and* explain it over coffee.*  

*Today, he’ll tackle one of autonomous driving’s biggest challenges: generating adversarial safety-critical scenarios without waiting for the universe to deliver them via Murphy’s Law. Spoiler: His team’s solution uses human driving priors and reinforcement learning to create *realistic* edge cases—with 44% greater efficiency than baseline models. So if you’ve ever wondered how we stress-test the AI drivers of the future, you’re in for a masterclass.*  

*Please join me in welcoming Professor Zijiang James Yang—and don’t forget those questions; this is your chance to poke at the mind ensuring robots don’t reinvent bumper cars!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*

## 📅 Event and Session Details  

### **Conference Overview**  
- **Name:** GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates:** May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location:** Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme:** *"Global Open-Source AI Collaboration"*  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Six tracks covering AI Model, AI Infra, AI Apps, Embodied AI, AI for Science, and Global Open-Source AI Collaboration.  
  - Hosted by GOSIM (Global Open-Source Innovation Meetup) and co-organized by CSDN.  

### **Session Details**  
- **Title:** *Adversarial Safety-Critical Scenario Generation for Autonomous Driving*  
- **Date:** May 6, 2025  
- **Time:** 14:00 - 14:40 (CEST)  
- **Content:**  
  Evaluating the decision-making system is indispensable in developing autonomous vehicles, while realistic and challenging safety-critical test scenarios play a crucial role. Obtaining these scenarios is non-trivial due to the long-tailed distribution, sparsity, and rarity in real-world data sets. To tackle this problem, we introduce a natural adversarial scenario generation solution using naturalistic human driving priors and reinforcement learning. Our experiments on public data sets demonstrate that our proposed model can generate realistic safety-critical test scenarios covering both naturalness and adversariality with **44% efficiency gain** over the baseline model.
