# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—a visionary who’s been championing open-source AI long before it was cool. Please join me in welcoming Michel-Marie Maudet, COO and Co-Founder of LINAGORA, and the driving force behind OpenLLM France!  

Michel-Marie isn’t just a tech leader; he’s a digital sovereignty crusader. From his early days optimizing systems for the Ministry of Defense to co-founding LINAGORA and launching LinTO—Europe’s answer to proprietary AI—he’s been on a mission to keep technology transparent, ethical, and, most importantly, *ours*.  

Today, he’s here to share the story of **LUCIE-7B**, one of the first truly open large language models—built from scratch with love (and 512 GPUs). He’ll take us behind the scenes of its creation, the challenges faced, and why an open approach isn’t just idealistic but essential for Europe’s AI future. Spoiler: It involves multilingual tokenizers, public data, and a 2025 roadmap that’s bolder than a French baguette.  

So, if you’re curious about how we build AI that’s *for the people, by the people*, you’re in the right room. Michel-Marie, the stage is yours—let’s geek out!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker)*
