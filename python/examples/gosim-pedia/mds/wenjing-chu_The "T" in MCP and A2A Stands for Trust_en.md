# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: The "T" in MCP and A2A Stands for Trust

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, if you’ll kindly direct your attention to the stage—it’s time to talk about the one thing we all wish came with a user manual: *trust* in the age of AI. And who better to guide us than someone who’s practically written the book on it?*  

*Please join me in welcoming **Wenjing Chu**, Senior Director of Technology Strategy at Futurewei and a founding board member of the Trust over IP Foundation. When she’s not busy architecting the future of digital trust or collecting awards (like the Open Source Leadership Award, no big deal), she’s convincing the tech world that security alone won’t cut it anymore. Spoiler: She’s right.*  

*Today, Wenjing will unravel *why the ‘T’ in MCP and A2A stands for Trust*—because, as she’ll explain, even ‘best practice’ security leaves gaps wide enough for an AI agent to drive a truck through. Expect a masterclass in trust primitives, why they matter, and how to bake them into your applications.*  

*So, lean in, take notes, and don’t be shy—questions are encouraged. Let’s give a warm welcome to Wenjing Chu!"*
