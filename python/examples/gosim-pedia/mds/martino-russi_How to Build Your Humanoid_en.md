# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, good [morning/afternoon]! It's a pleasure to welcome you to what promises to be a fascinating session.*  

*Our next speaker is Martino Russi, an Embodied Robotics Engineer at Hugging Face—or, as he might modestly put it, an 'aspiring mad scientist' on a quest to build this generation's Pinocchio. With a background blending neuroscience, AI, and robotics, Martino is democratizing robotics by making cutting-edge tech accessible—proving you don't need a fairy godmother to bring machines to life (just a lot of open-source code).*  

*Today, he'll take us on a journey titled 'How to Build Your Humanoid'—because why settle for a smart speaker when you can have a smart roommate? From his early days crafting data gloves to collaborating on humanoid projects, Martino will share insights on turning sci-fi dreams into open-source reality.*  

*So, whether you're here to build your own robotic sidekick or just curious about the future of embodied AI, get ready for a session that's equal parts inspiring and hands-on. Please join me in welcoming Martino Russi!"*  

**[Applause, transition to speaker.]**
