# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Designing Emotions for Robots

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

Now, if you‚Äôve ever wished your robot could give you a comforting pat on the back‚Äîor at least *look* like it cares‚Äîyou‚Äôre in for a treat. Our next speaker is **Anne-Charlotte Passanisi**, Senior Product Manager at Pollen Robotics and a driving force behind making robots not just functional, but *emotionally expressive*.  

Anne-Charlotte has spent years at the forefront of human-robot interaction, leading the development of Reachy2‚Äîa robot so charming, it might just out-empathize some humans. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, she played a pivotal role in Pollen Robotics‚Äô recent acquisition by Hugging Face, proving that open-source robotics is anything but mechanical when it comes to innovation.  

Today, she‚Äôs here to explore a fascinating question: *What happens when a robot starts to feel?* In her session, *‚ÄòDesigning Emotions for Robots,‚Äô* she‚Äôll take us through how speech, gestures, and even sound can transform cold, hard code into something resembling empathy. Spoiler: It‚Äôs not sci-fi‚Äîit‚Äôs happening *now*.  

So get ready for a session that‚Äôs equal parts mind-blowing and heartwarming (yes, we said *heartwarming* about robots). Anne-Charlotte, the virtual stage is yours‚Äîlet‚Äôs make some robots *feel!*"*  

*(Applause, smooth transition to speaker)*
