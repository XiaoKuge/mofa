# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—someone who’s clearly mastered the art of keeping databases *and* his cool under pressure. Please welcome Dongxu Huang, Co-Founder and CTO of PingCAP, the brains behind TiDB, a distributed SQL database so robust it probably has its own contingency plan.  

With a background in network security and a knack for turning technical chaos into elegant solutions, Dongxu has spent years pioneering open-source database innovation. From his early days as a software engineer to co-founding PingCAP, he’s been on a mission to make distributed systems both scalable and sane. Oh, and he’s also the author of *TiDB: A Raft-based HTAP Database*—because if you’re going to write a paper, why not make it a must-read at VLDB?  

Today, he’s here to tackle a topic that’s top of mind for anyone working with AI agents: *Database for Agents Memory, The Right Way*. We’re about to dive into the nitty-gritty of serverless SQL databases—schema design, indexing strategies, and how to avoid the pitfalls that turn ‘efficient’ into ‘oh no’ in production. Whether you’re optimizing for performance or just trying to keep your AI from forgetting its own name, this session promises actionable insights.  

So, get those questions ready—because when an expert like Dongxu speaks, you’ll want to listen. Let’s give it up for Dongxu Huang!"*
