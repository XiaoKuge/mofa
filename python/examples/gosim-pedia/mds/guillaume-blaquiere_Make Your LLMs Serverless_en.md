# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Speaker Session

## üé§ Host Introduction

*[With upbeat energy]*  
**Host:**  
"Ladies and gentlemen, let's give a warm welcome to our next speaker‚ÄîGuillaume Blaquiere, Group Data Architect at Carrefour and a Google Developer Expert in Cloud Platform. Now, if you've ever stared at a cloud bill and felt faint, Guillaume is the person you want in your corner. He's spent over 15 years turning tech complexity into elegant solutions, and today, he's here to save us all from the financial horror of overprovisioned GPUs.  

As a leader architecting data platforms across 30+ countries for Carrefour, Guillaume knows a thing or two about scale‚Äîand how to avoid paying for resources you don't need. His session, *'Make Your LLMs Serverless,'* will show us how Google Cloud Run's serverless GPU support can make deploying LLMs both smarter and cheaper. Spoiler: There's a live demo featuring the Gemma model, and yes, it involves actual cost savings.  

So, whether you're a cloud optimist, a frugal engineer, or just someone who likes seeing GPUs used responsibly, this is your session. Guillaume, take it away‚Äîand everyone, get those questions ready!"
