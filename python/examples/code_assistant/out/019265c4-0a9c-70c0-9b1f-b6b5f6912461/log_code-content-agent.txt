 		You are using the client SiliconFlowClient, which will be removed in DSPy 2.6.
 		Changing the client is straightforward and will let you use new features (Adapters) that improve the consistency of LM outputs, especially when using chat LMs.

Specifically:\n\n- In "1.py", the statement `print("hello world from 1.py")` outputs the string "hello world from 1.py" to the console.\n- In "2.py", the statement `print("hello world from 2.py")` outputs the string "hello world from 2.py" to the console.\n\nThere are no errors or complex logic in these snippets; they are straightforward examples of how to use the `print` function in Python to display messages to the user.'}
