 		You are using the client SiliconFlowClient, which will be removed in DSPy 2.6.
 		Changing the client is straightforward and will let you use new features (Adapters) that improve the consistency of LM outputs, especially when using chat LMs.

Specifically:\n\n- In "2.py", the code `print("hello world from 2.py")` outputs the string "hello world from 2.py" to the console.\n- In "1.py", the code `print("hello world from 1.py")` outputs the string "hello world from 1.py" to the console.\n\nBoth scripts are straightforward and do not contain any errors or complex logic. They are typical examples of introductory Python scripts used to demonstrate basic functionality, such as printing text to the console.'}
