 		You are using the client SiliconFlowClient, which will be removed in DSPy 2.6.
 		Changing the client is straightforward and will let you use new features (Adapters) that improve the consistency of LM outputs, especially when using chat LMs.

Each file contains a simple print statement:\n\n- "2.py" contains: `print("hello world from 2.py")`\n- "1.py" contains: `print("hello world from 1.py")`\n\nThere are no syntax errors or logical errors in the code snippets provided. Both files will execute their respective print statements when run. The user\'s question does not specify any particular issues or additional analysis requirements beyond the provided code snippets. The `dataflow_status` is true, indicating that the data flow is operational, though no specific data flow details are provided in the question.'}
