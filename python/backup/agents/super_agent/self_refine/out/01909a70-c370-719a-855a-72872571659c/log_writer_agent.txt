Germany lost World War II due to a combination of factors, including strategic mistakes, military setbacks, and the overwhelming power of the Allied forces. One key factor was Germany's decision to invade the Soviet Union, which ultimately led to a two-front war that stretched its resources thin. Additionally, the Allies' superior industrial capacity and ability to mobilize troops and resources played a significant role in Germany's defeat. Ultimately, Germany's aggressive expansionist policies and the resistance of the Allied forces proved to be insurmountable obstacles in their quest for victory.
