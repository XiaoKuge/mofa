This includes [**RESTful APIs**](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/restful_api), which make Open Library data availabile in JSON, YAML and RDF/XML formats. There's also an earlier, now deprecated [JSON API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/json_api) which is preserved for backward compatibility. \nTry out our interactive [OpenAPI sandbox](https://openlibrary.org/swagger/docs)! \n# Identifying your Application\nIf your application will make regular, frequent use of Open Library's APIs (e.g. multiple calls per minute), please add a HEADER that specifies a User-Agent string with (a) the name of your application and (b) your contact email or phone number, so we may contact you when we notice high request volume. Failing to include these headers may result in your application being blocked. \nFor help adding user-agent headers to your API calls, please refer to this [javascript](https://gist.github.com/mekarpeles/0d308bfd8e75858d2266b8aa983cac07) and [python](https://gist.github.com/mekarpeles/a4f1b2b0414325b9958fdc8376f14d16) example. \nAdditional rate limit information can be accessed [here](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/docker/nginx.conf). \n# Index of APIs\n  * [Book Search](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search) API - Search results for books, authors, and more \n  * [Work & Edition](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books) APIs - Retrieve a specific work or edition by identifier \n  * [My Books](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/mybooks) API - Retrieve books on a patron's public reading log \n  * [Authors](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/authors) API - Retrieve an author and their works by author identifier \n  * [Subjects](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/subjects) API - Fetch books by subject name \n  * [Search inside](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search_inside) API - Search for matching text within millions of books \n  * [Partner](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/read) API -- Formerly the \"Read\" API, fetch one or more books by library identifiers (ISBNs, OCLC, LCCNs) \n  * [Covers](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers) API - Fetch book covers by ISBN or Open Library identifier \n  * [Recent Changes](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/recentchanges) API - Programatic access to changes across Open Library \n  * [Lists](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/lists) API - Reading, modifying, or creating user lists \n  * History of an item can be accessed by appending `?m=history` to the page like [this](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL236414A.json?m=history). \n\n\n### Bulk Access\n**Please do not use our APIs for bulk download** of Open Library data because this affects our ability to serve patrons. We make our data [publicly available](https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps) each month for partners. If you want a dump of complete data, please read about our [Bulk Download](https://openlibrary.org/data#downloads) options, or email us at openlibrary@archive.org. \n### More APIs\nDid you know, nearly every page on Open Library is or has an API. You can return structured bibliographic data for any page by adding a .rdf/.json/.yml extension to the end of any Open Library identifier. For instance: <https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15626917W.json> or <https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL33421A.json>. Many pages, such as the Books, Authors, and Lists, will include links to their RDF and JSON formats. \n### Questions\nWe encourage developers to ask questions by opening issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues) and on our [gitter](https://gitter.im/theopenlibrary/Lobby) chat channel. \nFriends using Open Library APIs Several developers are creating amazing things with the Open Library APIs: \n  * [**Trove**](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) by _the National Library of Australia_ Trove is a new discovery experience focused on Australia and Australians. It supplements what search engines provide with reliable information from Australia's memory institutions. The system hits Open Library when public domain books turn up in searches, and displays links to Open Library. \n  * [**Koha**](https://koha-community.org/)Koha is an open source library system for public libraries that includes catalog searches and member organizing. It uses Open Library covers, displays OL related subjects, and lendable eBooks using the Read API. \n  * [**Evergreen**](https://evergreen-ils.org)Evergreen is highly-scalable software for libraries that helps library patrons find library materials, and helps libraries manage, catalog, and circulate those materials. It uses Open Library for covers, tables of contents, with plans to expand into other areas. \n  * [**read.gov**](https://read.gov/books/) by _the Library of Congress_ OK, this isn't exactly Open Library, but it's still awesome! The Library of Congress have modified the Internet Archive's Book Reader to sit perfectly within their Rare Books Collection site. \n  * [**OpenBook WordPress Plug-in**](https://code.google.com/p/openbook4wordpress/) by _John Miedema_ OpenBook is useful for anyone who wants to add book covers and other book data on a WordPress website. OpenBook links to detailed book information in Open Library, the main data source, as well as other book sites. Users have complete control over the display through templates. OpenBook can link to library records by configuring an OpenURL resolver or through a [WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/) link. OpenBook inserts [COinS](https://ocoins.info/) so that other applications like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) can pick up the book data. \n  * [**Umlaut**](https://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Umlaut) by _Jason Ronallo_ Umlaut is a middle-tier OpenURL link resolver that adds functions and services to commercial link resolving software. \n  * [**Virtual Shelf**](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2009/virtual-shelf) by _Jonathan Breitbart and Devin Blong_ (UC Berkeley School of Information)The Virtual Shelf is a visualization created by two students at the UC Berkeley School of Information. The project includes the student's master thesis, with research into the searching and browsing patterns of library patrons. The Open Library RESTful API was utilized during the project as a source of metadata for the user interface. \n  * [**RDC UI Toolkit**](https://ruraldesigncollective.org/lab/ui) by _Rural Design Collective_ This group created a suite of tools that facilitates the creation of localized user interfaces for public domain books. The RDC used the Open Library Covers API and the Internet Archive Book Reader in their online demonstration customized for the OLPC XO. \n  * [**Dreambooks.club**](https://ruraldesigncollective.org/lab/ui) by _Bernat Fortet_ Dreambooks is a portal and community where parents and children can discover new books to read together. Think of it as the online equivalent of your library's children's corner. All the book data is powered by OpenLibary's API. \n  * [**MyBooks.Life**](https://mybooks.life) by _Mark Webster_ MyBooks.Life is an android app and website designed primarily to manage TBR (to-be-read) lists. You can keep track of your reading progress, make notes, manage your wishlist, and rate your books. MyBooks.Life uses Open Library data to power its search. \n  * [**Bookmind**](https://apps.apple.com/app/bookmind/id6593662584) Bookmind is now available at <https://apps.apple.com/app/bookmind/id6593662584>. It uses open library’s api exclusively for book data. You can even see the rough prototype source at <https://github.com/dave-ruest/Bookmind>. \n\n\nAre you using the Open Library APIs? We'd love to hear about it!

The API allows you to access all the features that you see on Colormind.io. The API is free for personal and non-commercial use. If you're looking to use it in a commercial application, get in touch by email: jack@colormind.io To get a random color palette: ```\ncurl 'http://colormind.io/api/' --data-binary '{\"model\":\"default\"}'\n\t\t\t\t\t\n# {\"result\":[[214,78,69],[247,242,163],[201,216,147],[57,141,112],[62,80,64]]}\n\t\t\t\t\n```\nTo get color suggestions with input, label blank fields with the \"N\" character: ```\ncurl 'http://colormind.io/api/' --data-binary '{\"input\":[[44,43,44],[90,83,82],\"N\",\"N\",\"N\"],\"model\":\"default\"}'\n\t\t\t\t\t\n# {\"result\":[[49,47,49],[91,83,81],[133,155,143],[226,209,167],[235,198,126]]}\n\t\t\t\t\n```\nYou can use different models by passing in the model name. The models \"default\" and \"ui\" are always available, but others will change each day. To see which models are currently available, check the list endpoint: ```\ncurl 'http://colormind.io/list/'\n\t\t\t\t\t\n# {\"result\":[\"default\",\"ui\",\"makoto_shinkai\",\"metroid_fusion\",\"akira_film\",\"flower_photography\"]}\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n```\nThe models are refreshed every day at +8 UTC (midnight PDT). The service will be down for 30 seconds while the new models are loaded into memory. Query the API in Javascript like so: ```\n\nvar url = \"http://colormind.io/api/\";\nvar data = {\n\tmodel : \"default\",\n\tinput : [[44,43,44],[90,83,82],\"N\",\"N\",\"N\"]\n}\nvar http = new XMLHttpRequest();\nhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {\n\tif(http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 200) {\n\t\tvar palette = JSON.parse(http.responseText).result;\n\t}\n}\nhttp.open(\"POST\", url, true);\nhttp.send(JSON.stringify(data));\n// [[42, 41, 48], [90, 83, 84], [191, 157, 175], [188, 138, 125], [215, 170, 66]]\n// note that the input colors have changed as well, by a small amount\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n```\n\n[Colormind](http://colormind.io/) [Bootstrap UI](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/) [Templates](http://colormind.io/template/) [Blog](http://colormind.io/blog/) [API Access](http://colormind.io/api-access)\nGot questions?

A fuzzy algorithm is used (with a fuzziness value of 2), meaning that shows will be found even if your query contains small typos. Results are returned in order of relevancy (best matches on top) and contain each show's full information. \nThe most common usecase for this endpoint is when you're building a local mapping of show names to TVmaze ID's and want to make sure that you're mapping to exactly the right show, and not to a different show that happens to have the same name. By presenting each show's basic information in a UI, you can have the end-user pick a specific entry from that list, and have your application store the chosen show's ID or URL. Any subsequent requests for information on that show can then be directly made to that show's URL. \n  * URL: **/search/shows?q=:query**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=girls>\n\n\n#### Show single search\nIn some scenarios you might want to immediately return information based on a user's query, without the intermediary step of presenting them all the possible matches. In that case, you can use the singlesearch endpoint which either returns exactly one result, or no result at all. This endpoint is also forgiving of typos, but less so than the regular search (with a fuzziness of 1 instead of 2), to reduce the chance of a false positive. \nAs opposed to the regular search endpoint, the singlesearch endpoint allows embedding additional information in the result. See the section [embedding](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#embedding) for more information. \nBeware that if multiple shows exist with an identical name (for example, Top Gear) it's undefined which of them will be returned by this endpoint. If you want to be sure you're matching with the proper show, use the search endpoint instead. \n  * URL: **/singlesearch/shows?q=:query**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=girls>\n  * Example: [https://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=girls&embed=episodes](https://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=girls&embed=episodes)\n\n\n#### Show Lookup\nIf you already know a show's thetvdb or IMDB ID, you can use this endpoint to find this exact show on TVmaze. If the given ID can be matched, a HTTP 301 redirect to the show's URL will be returned. Otherwise, a HTTP 404 is sent. \n  * URL: **/lookup/shows?tvrage=:id** or **/lookup/shows?thetvdb=:id**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/lookup/shows?thetvdb=81189>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/lookup/shows?imdb=tt0944947>\n\n\n#### People search\nSearch through all the people in our database, using the same mechanism as described for show searches. \n  * URL: **/search/people?q=:query**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/search/people?q=lauren>\n\n\n### Schedule\nThe schedule is a complete list of episodes that air in a given country on a given date. Episodes are returned in the order in which they are aired, and full information about the episode and the corresponding show is included. \nThis endpoint will only return episodes that are tied to a specific country, either via a Network or via a local Web Channel such as HBO Max or Sky Go. Episodes from global Web Channels like Netflix are not included. \nNote that contrary to what you might expect, the ISO country code for the United Kingdom is not _UK_ , but _GB_. \n  * URL: **/schedule?country=:countrycode &date=:date**\n  * (optional) _countrycode_ : an [ISO 3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) code of the country; defaults to US \n  * (optional) _date_ : an [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Dates) formatted date; defaults to the current day \n  * Example: [https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule?country=US&date=2014-12-01](https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule?country=US&date=2014-12-01)\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule>\n\n\n#### Web/streaming schedule\nThe web schedule is a complete list of episodes that air on web/streaming channels on a given date. TVmaze distinguishes between local and global Web Channels: local Web Channels are only available in one specific country, while global Web Channels are available in multiple countries. To query both local and global Web Channels, leave out the _country_ parameter. To query only local Web Channels, set _country_ to an ISO country code. And to query only global Web Channels, set _country_ to an empty string. \n  * URL: **/schedule/web?country=:countrycode &date=:date**\n  * (optional) _countrycode_ : an [ISO 3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) code of the country \n  * (optional) _date_ : an [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Dates) formatted date; defaults to the current day \n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule/web?date=2020-05-29>\n  * Example: [https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule/web?date=2020-05-29&country=](https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule/web?date=2020-05-29&country=)\n  * Example: [https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule/web?date=2020-05-29&country=US](https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule/web?date=2020-05-29&country=US)\n\n\n#### Full schedule\nThe full schedule is a list of **all** future episodes known to TVmaze, regardless of their country. Be advised that this endpoint's response is at least several MB large. As opposed to the other endpoints, results are cached for 24 hours. \n  * URL: **/schedule/full**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/schedule/full>\n\n\n### Shows\n#### Show main information\nRetrieve all primary information for a given show. This endpoint allows embedding of additional information. See the section [embedding](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#embedding) for more information. \n  * URL: **/shows/:id**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1?embed=cast>\n\n\n#### Show episode list\nA complete list of episodes for the given show. Episodes are returned in their airing order, and include full episode information. By default, specials are not included in the list. \n  * URL: **/shows/:id/episodes**\n  * (optional) _specials_ : do include both significant and insignificant specials in the list \n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/episodes>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/episodes?specials=1>\n\n\n#### Show alternate lists\nAlternate episode lists for this show, for example DVD ordering. For a description of the different types of alternate lists that you can find, please refer to [the alternate episode policy](https://www.tvmaze.com/faq/40/alternate-episodes). \n  * URL: **/shows/:id/alternatelists**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/180/alternatelists>\n\n\n  * URL: **/alternatelists/:id**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/alternatelists/1>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/alternatelists/1?embed=alternateepisodes>\n\n\n  * URL: **/alternatelists/:id/alternateepisodes**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/alternatelists/1/alternateepisodes>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/alternatelists/1/alternateepisodes?embed=episodes>\n\n\n#### Episode by number\nRetrieve one specific episode from this show given its season number and episode number. This either returns the full information for one episode, or a HTTP 404. \n  * URL: **/shows/:id/episodebynumber?season=:season &number=:number**\n  * _season_ : a season number\n  * _number_ : an episode number\n  * Example: [https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/episodebynumber?season=1&number=1](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/episodebynumber?season=1&number=1)\n\n\n#### Episodes by date\nRetrieve all episodes from this show that have aired on a specific date. This either returns an array of full episode info, or a HTTP 404. Useful for daily (talk) shows that don't adhere to a common season numbering. \n  * URL: **/shows/:id/episodesbydate?date=:date**\n  * _date_ : an [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Dates) formatted date \n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/episodesbydate?date=2013-07-01>\n\n\n#### Show seasons\nA complete list of seasons for the given show. Seasons are returned in ascending order and contain the full information that's known about them. \n  * URL: **/shows/:id/seasons**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/seasons>\n\n\n##### Season episodes\nA list of episodes in this season. Specials are always included in this list. This endpoint allows embedding of additional information. \n  * URL: **/seasons/:id/episodes**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/seasons/1/episodes>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/seasons/1/episodes?embed=guestcast>\n\n\n#### Show cast\nA list of main cast for a show. Each cast item is a combination of a person and a character. Items are ordered by importance, which is determined by the total number of appearances of the given character in this show. \n  * URL: **/shows/:id/cast**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/cast>\n\n\n#### Show crew\nA list of main crew for a show. Each crew item is a combination of a person and their crew type. \n  * URL: **/shows/:id/crew**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/crew>\n\n\n#### Show AKA's\nA list of AKA's (aliases) for a show. An AKA with its country set to null indicates an AKA in the show's original country. Otherwise, it's the AKA for that show in the given foreign country. \n  * URL: **/shows/:id/akas**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/akas>\n\n\n#### Show images\nA list of all images available for this show. The image type can be \"poster\", \"banner\", \"background\", \"typography\", or NULL in case of legacy unclassified images. For a definition of these types, please refer to the [main image](https://www.tvmaze.com/faq/42/show-main-images) and [general image](https://www.tvmaze.com/faq/44/show-image-general-guidelines) policies. \nAll image types are available under the \"original\" resolution; posters and banners are also available as a smaller resized version (\"medium\"). \n  * URL: **/shows/:id/images**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1/images>\n\n\n#### Show index\nA list of all shows in our database, with all primary information included. You can use this endpoint for example if you want to build a local cache of all shows contained in the TVmaze database. This endpoint is paginated, with a maximum of 250 results per page. The pagination is based on show ID, e.g. page 0 will contain shows with IDs between 0 and 250. This means a single page might contain less than 250 results, in case of deletions, but it also guarantees that deletions won't cause shuffling in the page numbering for other shows. \nBecause of this, you can implement a daily/weekly sync simply by starting at the page number where you last left off, and be sure you won't skip over any entries. For example, if the last show in your local cache has an ID of 1800, you would start the re-sync at page number _floor(1800/250) =_ 7. After this, simply increment the page number by 1 until you receive a HTTP 404 response code, which indicates that you've reached the end of the list. \nAs opposed to the other endpoints, results from the show index are cached for up to 24 hours. \n  * URL: **/shows?page=:num**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows?page=1>\n\n\n### Episodes\n#### Episode main information\nRetrieve all primary information for a given episode. This endpoint allows embedding of additional information. See the section [embedding](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#embedding) for more information. \n  * URL: **/episodes/:id**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1?embed=show>\n\n\n#### Episode guest cast\nRetrieve all guest cast starring in an episode. \n  * URL: **/episodes/:id/guestcast**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1/guestcast>\n\n\n#### Episode guest crew\nRetrieve all guest crew working on an episode. \n  * URL: **/episodes/:id/guestcrew**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1/guestcrew>\n\n\n### People\n#### Person main information\nRetrieve all primary information for a given person. This endpoint allows embedding of additional information. See the section [embedding](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#embedding) for more information. \n  * URL: **/people/:id**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/people/1>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/people/1?embed=castcredits>\n\n\n#### Person cast credits\nRetrieve all (show-level) cast credits for a person. A cast credit is a combination of both a show and a character. By default, only a reference to each show and character will be returned. However, this endpoint supports embedding, which means full information for the shows and characters can be included. \n  * URL: **/people/:id/castcredits**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/people/1/castcredits>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/people/1/castcredits?embed=show>\n\n\n#### Person crew credits\nRetrieve all (show-level) crew credits for a person. A crew credit is combination of both a show and a crew type. By default, only a reference to each show will be returned. However, this endpoint supports embedding, which means full information for the shows can be included. \n  * URL: **/people/:id/crewcredits**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/people/100/crewcredits>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/people/100/crewcredits?embed=show>\n\n\n#### Person guest cast credits\nRetrieve all (episode-level) guest cast credits for a person. A guest cast credit is a combination of both an episode and a character. By default, only a reference to each episode and character will be returned. However, this endpoint supports embedding, which means full information for the episodes and characters can be included. \n  * URL: **/people/:id/guestcastcredits**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/people/1/guestcastcredits>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/people/1/guestcastcredits?embed=episode>\n\n\n#### Person index\nLike the [show index](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-index) but for people; please refer to the show index documentation. A maximum of 1000 results per page is returned. \n  * URL: **/people?page=:num**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/people>\n\n\n### Updates\n#### Show updates\nA list of all shows in the TVmaze database and the timestamp when they were last updated. Updating a direct or indirect child of a show will also mark the show itself as updated. For example; creating, deleting or updating an episode or an episode's gallery item will mark the episode's show as updated. It's possible to filter the resultset to only include shows that have been updated in the past day (24 hours), week, or month. \n  * URL: **/updates/shows**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/updates/shows>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/updates/shows?since=day>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/updates/shows?since=week>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/updates/shows?since=month>\n\n\n#### Person updates\nLike the [show updates](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-updates) endpoint, but for people. A person is considered to be updated when any of their attributes are changed, but also when a cast- or crew-credit that involves them is created or deleted. \n  * URL: **/updates/people**\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/updates/people>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/updates/people?since=day>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/updates/people?since=week>\n  * Example: <https://api.tvmaze.com/updates/people?since=month>\n\n\n## Embedding\nAs defined by the [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) convention, our API resources can contain _links_ to related URLs. These URLs can refer to either a collection (like a list of episodes), or to an individual resource (like an episode). References to an individual resource are always advertised in the model's __links_ , for example as a show's __links.previousepisode_ or a cast credit's __links.character_. References to collections are not actively advertised in the __links_ output, but are documented here. Both types of links can be embedded in the response by using the _embed_ query parameter. \nFor example, [ https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1?embed=episodes](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1?embed=episodes) will serve the show's main information and its episode list in one single response. <https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1?embed=nextepisode> would embed the details of that show's upcoming episode in the response, but only if one such episode currently exists. Embedding multiple links is possible with the array syntax: [ https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1?embed[]=episodes&embed[]=cast](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1?embed\\[\\]=episodes&embed\\[\\]=cast)\n## Images\nMost resources available in the API have an _image_ property that refers to that item's primary image. For shows, people and characters this is an image in poster format; for episodes the image is in landscape format. If an image exists, the _image_ property will be a dictionary containing a \"medium\" and \"original\" key, referring to the image in fixed resized dimensions or in the original uploaded resolution. If no image exists yet, the _image_ property will be NULL. \nYou are free to directly link (\"hotlink\") to our image CDN. However, for performance reasons we recommend to cache the images on your end: on your own server in case of a web application, or on the client in case of a desktop/mobile app. Images can safely be cached indefinitely: on our end the content of a specific image URL will never change; if an item's primary image changes, the item's image URL will change instead. \n## HTTPS\nAll endpoints and links embedded in the API response - to other API endpoints or to our image CDN - are HTTPS by default, but it's possible to access them over unencrypted HTTP as well. \n## Caching\nAll output is cached by our HTTP load balancers for 60 minutes, so when information is updated on the site, please allow up to 1 hour for the changes to propagate to the API. \n## Rate limiting\nAPI calls are rate limited to allow _at least_ **20 calls every 10 seconds** per IP address. If you exceed this rate, you might receive an HTTP 429 error. We say _at least_ , because rate limiting takes place on the backend but not on the edge cache. So if your client is only requesting common/popular endpoints like _shows_ or _episodes_ (as opposed to more unique endpoints like searches or embedding), you're likely to never hit the limit. For an optimal throughput, simply let your client back off for a few seconds when it receives a 429. \nUnder special circumstances we may temporarily have to impose a stricter rate limit. So even if your client wouldn't normally exceed our rate limit, it's useful to gracefully handle HTTP 429 responses: simply retry the request after a small pause instead of treating it as a permanent failure. \nAdditionally, you should ensure that HTTP connections are not unnecessarily left open. Either explicitly close the HTTP connection after every request, re-use connections for subsequent requests, or make use of HTTP2 multiplexing. Leaving more than 1 connection to our servers idle may result in your IP getting blocked. \nWhile not required, we strongly recommend setting your client's HTTP User Agent to something that'll uniquely describe it. This allows us to identify your application in case of problems, or to proactively reach out to you. \n## CORS\nAll endpoints are [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (Cross-origin resource sharing) enabled, which means our API can be used directly in web applications without having to resort to JSONP or HTTP proxying. \n## Licensing\nUse of the TVmaze API is licensed by [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). This means the data can freely be used for any purpose, as long as TVmaze is properly credited as source and your usage complies with the ShareAlike provision. You can satisfy the attribution requirement by linking back to TVmaze from within your application or website, for example using the URLs available in the API. \n## Enterprise API\nDoes your usecase require data or functionality not available in the public API?

This API is the same tool that powers our [website (opens new window)](https://www.artic.edu), our [mobile app (opens new window)](https://www.artic.edu/visit/explore-on-your-own/mobile-app-audio-tours), and many other technologies in the museum.\nIf the application you're building will be public, please send it our way! We'd love to share it alongside some of the [other projects that use our API (opens new window)](https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api). And if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us: engineering@artic.edu.\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#quick-start) Quick Start\nAn [API (opens new window)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ygVYCupdo) is a structured way that one software application can talk to another. APIs power much of the software we use today, from the apps on our phones and watches to technology we see in sports and TV shows. We have built an API to let people like you easily get our data in an ongoing way.\nTIP\nDo you want _all_ of our data? Are you running into problems with [throttling](https://api.artic.edu/docs#authentication) or [deep pagination](https://api.artic.edu/docs#pagination)? Consider using our [data dumps](https://api.artic.edu/docs#data-dumps) instead of our API.\nFor example, you can access the `/artworks` listing endpoint in our API by visiting the following URL to see all the published artworks in our collection:\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks\n\n```\n\nIf you want to see data for just one artwork, you can use the `/artworks/{id}` detail endpoint. For example, here's [_Starry Night and the Astronauts_ (opens new window)](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/129884/starry-night-and-the-astronauts) by Alma Thomas:\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/129884\n\n```\n\nWhen you view these URLs in your browser, you might see a jumbled bunch of text. That's OK! If you're using Chrome, install the [JSON Formatter extension (opens new window)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa), hit reload, and the results will be formatted in a way humans can read, too.\nThere is a lot of data you'll get for each artwork. If you want to only retrieve a certain set of fields, change the `fields` parameter in the query to list which ones you want, like this:\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?fields=id,title,artist_display,date_display,main_reference_number\n\n```\n\nTIP\nThe `fields` parameter expects either an array of field names, or a comma-separated list of field names in a single string (e.g. example above). We encourage you to use it because it makes your queries run faster and lets us track which fields need continued support.\nYou can [paginate](https://api.artic.edu/docs#pagination) through results using `page` and `limit` params:\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?page=2&limit=100\n\n```\n\nIf you want to search and filter the results, you can do so via our search endpoints. For example, here is a [full-text search (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search) for all artworks whose metadata contains some mention of cats:\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q=cats\n\n```\n\nHere is the same search, but filtered to only show artworks that are in the public domain:\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q=cats&query[term][is_public_domain]=true\n\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, our search is powered by [Elasticsearch (opens new window)](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch). You can use its [Query DSL (opens new window)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) to interact with our API. The example above uses a [`term` (opens new window)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-term-query.html) query. Other queries we use often include [`exists` (opens new window)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-exists-query.html) and [`bool` (opens new window)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-bool-query.html). [Aggregations (opens new window)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html) are also a powerful tool.\nOur API accepts queries through both `GET` and `POST`. It might be easier to visualize how the `GET` query above is structured by comparing it to its `POST` equivallent:\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n  \"q\": \"cats\",\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"is_public_domain\": true\n    }\n  }\n}'\n\n```\n\nFor production use, we recommend using `GET` and passing the entire query as minified URL-encoded JSON via the `params` parameter. For example:\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?params=%7B%22q%22%3A%22cats%22%2C%22query%22%3A%7B%22term%22%3A%7B%22is_public_domain%22%3Atrue%7D%7D%7D\n\n```\n\nWARNING\nOur API is flexible in how it accepts queries, but each method of querying is meant for a specific purpose. Use `GET` for simple queries, and use `POST` when you have complex payloads to submit with your query.\nThere's a lot of information you can get about our collection, and there's a lot more than artworks in our API. Explore our documentation to learn more!\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#conventions) Conventions\n  * We refer to models in our API as \"resources\" (e.g. `artworks`, `artists`, `places`)\n  * Resources are typically accessed via their endpoints. Each resource has three endpoints:\n    * Listing (e.g. `/artworks`)\n    * Detail (e.g. `/artworks/{id}`)\n    * Search (e.g. `/artworks/search`) (optional)\nSome resources might lack a search endpoint if there appears to be no need for it yet.\n  * Multi-word endpoints are hyphenated (e.g. `/tour-stop`).\n  * All field names are lowercase and snake case (underscore case).\n  * Every resource in the API has `id` and `title` fields.\n  * Fields that contain a single id reference to another resource are singular and end with `_id`:\n```\n\"artist_id\": 51349,\n\n```\n\n  * Fields that contain id references to multiple records from another resource are singular and end with `_ids`:\n```\n\"style_ids\": [\"TM-4439\", \"TM-8542\", \"TM-4441\"],\n\n```\n\n  * Fields that contain title references to records from other resources follow naming conventions similar to id-based fields:\n```\n\"artist_title\": \"Ancient Roman\",\n\"classification_titles\": [\"modern and contemporary art\", \"painting\"],\n\n```\n\n  * Every title-based field has a `keyword` subfield in Elasticsearch, which is meant for filters and aggregations. See \"New defaults\" section in [this article (opens new window)](https://www.elastic.co/blog/strings-are-dead-long-live-strings) for more info.\n  * Numeric and boolean fields get parsed into actual numbers and booleans:\n```\n\"artwork_id\": \"45\", // BAD\n\"date_start\": 1942, // GOOD\n\"is_preferred\": \"True\", // BAD\n\"is_in_gallery\": true, // GOOD\n\n```\n\n  * We never show any empty strings in the API. We only show `null`:\n```\n\"date_display\": \"\", // BAD\n\"artist_display\": null, // GOOD\n\n```\n\n  * We prefer to always show all fields, even if they are `null` for the current record:\n    * If a field that typically returns a string, number, or object is empty for a given record, we return it as `null`, rather than omitting it.\n    * If a field typically returns an array, we prefer to return an empty array, rather than returning `null`. This is done in part for backwards-compatibility reasons.\n\n\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#best-practices) Best Practices\nHere are some tips that will make your application run faster and/or reduce load on our systems:\n  * Cache API responses in your system when possible.\n  * Use the `fields` parameter to tell us exactly what fields you need.\n  * Batch detail queries with the multi-id parameter (`?ids=`).\n  * Batch search queries with [multi-search](https://api.artic.edu/docs#multi-search) (`/msearch`).\n  * When [downloading images](https://api.artic.edu/docs#images), use `/full/843,/0/default.jpg` parameters.\n  * When scraping, please use a single thread and self-throttle.\n  * Consider using [data dumps](https://api.artic.edu/docs#data-dumps) instead of scraping our API.\n\n\n## [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#data-dumps) Data Dumps\nYou can download a dump that contains all of our public data here:\n<https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/api-data>[ (opens new window)](https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/api-data)\nThese data dumps are updated nightly. They are generated from our API. As such, they contain the same data as our API, and their schema mirrors that of the API. The data is dumped in JSON format, with one JSON file per record. Records are grouped by API resource type.\nOur intention with this approach is to make it easier to adapt code to draw from the data dumps instead of the API, and vice-versa. Since the schema is the same, switching between the two should be relatively straight-forward.\nIf you notice schema discrepancies between the data dumps and the API, or if you need help with using our data dumps, please [open an issue (opens new window)](https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/api-data/issues) in the `api-data` repo.\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#data-dumps-vs-api) Data Dumps vs. API?\nWe recommend using the data dumps for scenarios such as the following:\n  * You want to have a full copy of our data for archival purposes.\n  * You want to scrape a large result set (>10,000 records).\n  * You want to analyze or enhance our data.\n\n\nUse our API if the following fits your use case:\n  * You want to integrate our data into a website or application.\n  * You need real-time access to our data.\n\n\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#scraping-data) Scraping Data\nGenerally, we ask that you avoid extensive scraping of our API. The API is meant for direct integration into websites and applications. The data dumps are meant for backups and analysis. Scraping our API puts undue stress on our systems. Instead of scraping, please download the data dumps and filter them locally to obtain the data you need.\nThat said, we don't mind small-scale scraping of our API. It can be convenient to use our search endpoint to filter records and retrieve only the fields you need. You can even use the [aggregation](https://api.artic.edu/docs#aggregations) functionality of our search endpoints to run some simple analyses. Just remember that you cannot paginate beyond 10,000 results in our search endpoints (see [Pagination](https://api.artic.edu/docs#pagination)).\nIf you do decide to scrape our resources, please throttle your requests to no more than one per second and avoid running multiple scrapers in parallel.\n## [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#images) Images\nThis API does not contain image files. However, it does contain all of the data you need to access our images. Our institution serves images via a separate API that is compliant with the [IIIF Image API 2.0 (opens new window)](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/) specification. Using metadata from this API, you can craft URLs that will allow you to access images of artworks from our collection.\nThe [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) (opens new window)](https://iiif.io/) stewards a set of open standards that enables rich access to digital media from libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural institutions around the world. In practical terms, they define several API specifications that enable interoperability. When a tool is built to be IIIF-compliant, it's easier to adapt it to consume images from any number of institutions that offer IIIF-compliant APIs.\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#iiif-image-api) IIIF Image API\nWe deliver our images via the [IIIF Image API 2.0 (opens new window)](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/). Our IIIF URLs have the following structure:\n```\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}.{format}\n\n```\n\nWe recommend the following URL structure for most use-cases:\n```\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg\n\n```\n\nLet's jump right into an example. Here's how you can construct IIIF URLs:\n  1. Retrieve one or more artworks with `image_id` fields. Here are a few ways of doing so:\n```\n# La Grande Jatte\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/27992?fields=id,title,image_id\n# La Grande Jatte and The Bedroom\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?ids=27992,28560&fields=id,title,image_id\n# Top two public domain artworks\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?query[term][is_public_domain]=true&limit=2&fields=id,title,image_id\n\n```\n\nLet's go with the first one, [_La Grande Jatte_ (opens new window)](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884). Your response will look something like this:\n```\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": 27992,\n    \"title\": \"A Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884\",\n    \"image_id\": \"2d484387-2509-5e8e-2c43-22f9981972eb\"\n  },\n  \"config\": {\n    \"iiif_url\": \"https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2\",\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n  2. Find the base IIIF Image API endpoint in the `config.iiif_url` field:\n```\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2\n\n```\n\nWe recommend that you avoid hardcoding this value into your applications.\n  3. Append the `image_id` of the artwork as a segment to this URL:\n```\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/2d484387-2509-5e8e-2c43-22f9981972eb\n\n```\n\n  4. Append `/full/843,/0/default.jpg` to the URL:\n```\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/2d484387-2509-5e8e-2c43-22f9981972eb/full/843,/0/default.jpg\n\n```\n\n\n\nThat's it! This is a valid IIIF URL. It will return the same image as we use on our website:\n![La Grande Jatte](https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/2d484387-2509-5e8e-2c43-22f9981972eb/full/843,/0/default.jpg)\nSome artworks also have `alt_image_ids`, such as the [Coronation Stone of Motecuhzoma II (opens new window)](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/75644/coronation-stone-of-motecuhzoma-ii-stone-of-the-five-suns):\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/75644?fields=id,title,image_id,alt_image_ids\n\n```\n\nExhibitions have images, too:\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/exhibitions/4568?fields=id,title,image_id,alt_image_ids\n\n```\n\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#image-sizes) Image Sizes\nThe [IIIF Image API 2.0 (opens new window)](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/) has a lot of options. However, we prefer to use it conservatively. As mentioned above, here's the URL pattern we use for most projects:\n```\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg\n\n```\n\nWe recommend using `/full/843,/0/default.jpg` because this is the most common size used by our website, so there's a good chance that the image has previously been requested and cached. If you use this pattern in your projects, it will make images load faster in your application and decrease load on our systems.\nTIP\nWe don't mind if you hotlink to our images. Our images support CORS with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` headers—same as our API responses! However, please be aware that any image can get unpublished or replaced at any time.\nIf you'd like to display the full image at smaller sizes, we recommend the following size increments, as these are likely to give you a cache hit as well:\n```\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/200,/0/default.jpg\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/400,/0/default.jpg\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/600,/0/default.jpg\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg\n\n```\n\nIf you are accessing public domain images, you may also use the following pattern for larger images:\n```\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/1686,/0/default.jpg\n\n```\n\nHowever, we still recommend using `843` instead unless there's a clear need for `1686`.\nWhy the strange number—843px wide? This number is related to certain [guidelines for the use of copyrighted materials (opens new window)](https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/Guidelines%20for%20the%20Use%20of%20Copyrighted%20Materials.pdf) within the museum field. Over time, it became the most common dimension used by our applications, so it is the size we continue to recommend.\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#iiif-manifests) IIIF Manifests\nWe also offer IIIF Manifests for all of our public domain artworks. A manifest is a resource defined by the [IIIF Presentation API (opens new window)](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.0/). Each manifest contains artwork metadata—such as title, artist name, and copyright info—alongside a list of images associated with that artwork.\nYou can access the manifest by appending `/manifest.json` after the identifier in an artwork detail endpoint. For example, here is the manifest for [The Great Wave (opens new window)](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/24645/under-the-wave-off-kanagawa-kanagawa-oki-nami-ura-also-known-as-the-great-wave-from-the-series-thirty-six-views-of-mount-fuji-fugaku-sanjurokkei):\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/24645/manifest.json\n\n```\n\nThese IIIF manifests do not contain any data that cannot be found elsewhere in our API. But because they follow a standardized API, they can be used with IIIF-compliant tools, such as [Mirador (opens new window)](https://projectmirador.org/). For a fun example, try pasting the URL above into the [Getty's Animal Crossing Art Generator (opens new window)](https://experiments.getty.edu/ac-art-generator#iiifloader)—and scroll up to see the result!\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#image-dumps) Image Dumps\nUnfortunately, we cannot offer image dumps at this time. We are exploring that possibility.\nFor now, you may scrape images from our IIIF Image API. We ask that you please follow our guidelines for [scraping images](https://api.artic.edu/docs#scraping-images) if you decide to do so.\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#scraping-images) Scraping Images\nGenerally, we prefer that you hotlink to our images, rather than scraping them. Scraping images can put unnecessary strain on our systems. That said, we understand that many use-cases require images to be stored locally.\nIf you'd like to scrape images from our IIIF API, please follow these guidelines:\n  * Scrape one image at a time—do not use multiple threads or processes!\n  * Consider adding a delay of 1 second between each image download\n  * Use the following URL pattern to download our [most common image size](https://api.artic.edu/image-sizes):\n```\nhttps://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg\n\n```\n\n\n\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#copyright) Copyright\nFor information about copyright, please see the [Image Licensing (opens new window)](https://www.artic.edu/image-licensing) and [Terms (opens new window)](https://www.artic.edu/terms) pages on our website. We defer to those resources in all legal respects.\nFrom a developer's perspective, we recommend only using images from artworks that are tagged as public domain. When querying for artworks, you can filter by public domain status like so:\n```\nhttps://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?query[term][is_public_domain]=true&limit=0\n\n```\n\nTo get the full list of artworks that are in the public domain, you will need to download our [data dumps](https://api.artic.edu/docs#data-dumps) and perform the filtering locally.\nPlease note that you may encounter images that are not public domain via our [IIIF Image API](https://api.artic.edu/docs#iiif-image-api). It is up to you to determine whether or not you are allowed to use these images for your use-case and to obtain any necessary permissions.\n## [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#general-information) General Information\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#authentication) Authentication\nYou may access our API without authentication. Anonymous users are throttled to 60 requests per minute. (Each IP counts as a separate user.) If you are working on an application that needs to exceed this restriction, please get in touch with us at engineering@artic.edu.\nPlease use [HTTPS (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) to access our API. To support legacy applications, our API is currently accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS, but HTTP access will be removed in the future.\nLastly, consider adding a `AIC-User-Agent` header with the name of your project and a contact email to your API requests. For example:\n```\ncurl 'https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/24645' \\\n--header 'AIC-User-Agent: aic-bash (engineering@artic.edu)'\n\n```\n\nWe ask that you do so as a [matter of courtesy (opens new window)](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01). If we see an application using a disproportionate amount of system resources, this gives us an avenue to reach out and work with you to optimize your queries.\nTIP\nWhy `AIC-User-Agent`? Because modifying the `User-Agent` header is [forbidden by some browsers (opens new window)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42815087/sending-a-custom-user-agent-string-along-with-my-headers-fetch). We are using the `AIC-` namespace to reduce potential conflicts with other applications ([RFC 6648 (opens new window)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6648)).\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#pagination) Pagination\nListing and search endpoints are paginated. We show 12 records per page by default. Pagination can be controlled via the following query parameters:\n  * `page` to request a specific page of results (1-based, default: 1)\n  * `limit` to set how many records each page should return (0-based, default: 12)\n\n\n**Example:** [https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artists?page=2&limit=10 (opens new window)](https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artists?page=2&limit=10)\nFor performance reasons, `limit` cannot exceed 100. Additionally, you cannot request more than 10,000 records from a single search query through any combination of `limit` and `page`. For example:\n  * **Success:** [https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artists/search?limit=100&page=100 (opens new window)](https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artists/search?limit=100&page=100)\n  * **Error:** [https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artists/search?limit=100&page=101 (opens new window)](https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artists/search?limit=100&page=101)\n\n\nGenerally, we ask that you avoid scraping our API. If you want to filter and scrape our search results, but the number of results is greater than 10,000, you won't be able to scrape them fully. Instead, we recommend that you download our [data dumps](https://api.artic.edu/docs#data-dumps) and perform your filtering locally.\nOccasionally, it might be useful to check the total number of results without retrieving any data. Our API supports this by allowing you to make a request with `limit=0`. For example, check `pagination.total` of this query to see the number of public domain artworks in our API:\n[https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?query[term][is_public_domain]=true&limit=0 (opens new window)](https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?query%5Bterm%5D%5Bis_public_domain%5D=true&limit=0)\nAll paginated endpoints include a `pagination` block in their responses:\n```\n{\n  \"pagination\": {\n    \"total\": 112773,\n    \"limit\": 12,\n    \"offset\": 24, // 0-based\n    \"current_page\": 3, // 1-based\n    \"total_pages\": 9398,\n    \"prev_url\": \"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?page=2&limit=12\",\n    \"next_url\": \"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?page=4&limit=12\"\n  },\n  \"data\": [\n    // ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n## [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#endpoints) Endpoints\n### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#collections) Collections\n#### [#](https://api.artic.edu/docs#artworks) Artworks\n_The`description` field in this response is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic License (CC-By) and the Terms and Conditions of [artic.edu (opens new window)](http://artic.edu).

I'm Andrew.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 2<br>And I'm Melissa.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 1<br>And we're so excited that you decided to check out the multi-sensory gallery at the Art Institute.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 2<br>And that you're listening to the audio tour.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 1<br>Melissa, that word multisensory is kind of a mouthful. What does it mean?</p>\\n<p>Speaker 2<br>Well, we know about the human senses. You know, sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell. Most of the time we're using them in combinations. Hearing and touching at the same time, for instance. That's multi-sensory. And artworks are something where we use all of our senses to take them in.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 1<br>Wait hold on. Last time I checked, we weren't supposed to touch things at the museum, let alone taste or smell them.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 2<br>You're right about that. We shouldn't touch things, and we definitely shouldn't taste anything in the galleries because it'll damage the works of art. But here in the multi-sensory gallery, we've got really cool things that you can touch and tap to see how they might feel and sound. And you can imagine how they might taste and smell too.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 1<br>You know, artists also use their senses when they're creating works of art, choosing a block of wood for carving or feeling the heat of a super hot furnace for melting metal, turning greasy wool into yarn, or digging into a block of marble. That's all really physical work that requires a lot of coordination between the mind and the body.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 2<br>That's right. And we're going to meet four artists and hear about how they use their materials and their tools to create the works that are hanging in this gallery.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 1<br>You can, of course, listen as you look, but we also encourage you to run your hand over the surface of each of the works of art as you hear how they were made.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 2<br>We'll let you know where you can find other works of art made out of these materials in the museums galleries. But remember, this is the only place we're allowed to touch. The two of us will be in so much trouble if everyone starts touching things out there.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 1<br>Yeah, no touching and definitely no licking.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 2<br>Yeah. Andrew, I really don't think that's on anyone's mind.</p>\\n<p>Speaker 1<br>I know. I just, you know, need to remind myself sometimes. All right. I think that about covers it. Get your senses ready and we'll see what the first artwork.</p>\\n\",\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 5285,\n      \"api_model\": \"mobile-sounds\",\n      \"api_link\": \"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/mobile-sounds/5285\",\n      \"title\": \"T51_07_255294_UrhoboMotherChildFigure_V4.mp3\",\n      \"web_url\": \"https://www.artic.edu/mobile/audio/T51_07_255294_UrhoboMotherChildFigure_V4.mp3\",\n      \"transcript\": \"<p>Curatorial fellow Janet Purdy.</p>\\n<p>Janet Purdy</p>\\n<p>The most important thing about this figure is that it depicts a mother. And in Urhobo culture, it's a representation of maternity and women and the role they play in society.</p>\\n<p>Perkins Foss</p>\\n<p>She is a figure known as Edjo and she would be one of a group of individuals carved. And of course, that would be in a shrine that is commemorating, some would say, founding heroes, the founding family that settled an Urhobo community. Hi, I'm Perkins Foss and I am a retired associate professor of the history of art at Penn State University. Her stature as a senior titled individual is the ring, I guess we could say of... it's beads. It goes from shoulder, it continues down to her breast and up the other side. She's got a coiffure, only fragments of which are still left. That is a number of vertical tufts that would be tied off in such a way that it's almost, in a European sense, crown-like.</p>\\n<p>Janet Purdy</p>\\n<p>One of the important things to look at this is that the representation of the jewelry is showing different fashions of different times, and so these kind of figures would differ across different regions in the Niger delta. They would, over time, their adornment would change, and while we can't really see this woman's hairstyle, it would've been a very fashionable, really elaborate hairstyle represented at the time that this was carved.</p>\\n<p>One of my favorite quotes is from a prolific Urhobo artist. His name is Bruce Onobrakpeya, and he's one of the biggest print makers in all of Africa, not just West Africa. And one of the things that he says about Urhobo art in general is, his quote is that &quot;art itself is the reflection of the life of people&quot;, and he's trying to carry that forward in whatever art form. He makes prints, but his father was a carver, so he's trying to make sure that whatever art forms that Urhobo people continue to create, that they reflect their life and culture and spirituality.</p>\\n\",\n      ...\n    }\n  ],\n  \"info\": {\n    \"license_text\": \"The data in this response may be protected by copyright, and other restrictions, of the Art Institute of Chicago and third parties.

But they typically were used to represent political figures or scholars.</p>\\n<p>NARRATOR: Until Van Dyck\\u2019 created the Iconography. In this series of prints he not only included political leaders and other renowned citizens, but artists as well, signaling their growing importance in 17th century European society. The Art Institute is fortunate to own all of Van Dyck\\u2019s etchings for this project, and they are exhibited here for the first time in almost a century.</p>\\n<p>The artist began the series by casually creating 15 portraits, expecting that expert printmakers would finish his plates. He could hardly have anticipated the interest these \\u2018unfinished\\u2019 prints would generate.</p>\\n<p>In this portrait of artist Justus Sustermans, Van Dyck paid great attention to detail in his sitter\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: And then from there, the description of the sitter becomes increasingly abstract. And we eventually get to the painter\\u2019s right hand, which is drawn in with just the most preliminary and rudimentary lines, sort of square-shaped fingertips, and no shading whatsoever.</p>\\n<p>NARRATOR: This contrast between detailed depiction and imaginative abstraction is precisely what caught a collector\\u2019s eye and what still seems so modern about Van Dyck\\u2019s etchings today. Van Dyck\\u2019s self-portrait is probably the first unfinished print ever to have been produced in an edition.</p>\\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: Like most of the etchings that Van Dyck made, this print shows the effects of an imperfectly polished copper plate. So we see scratches, particularly in the upper register. There\\u2019s various other passages where a more conscientious printmaker would have taken pains to remove blemishes or imperfections. But these seemed not to bother Van Dyck very much, nor did it bother some of the early collectors.</p>\\n<p>NARRATOR: Those collectors immediately embraced van Dyck\\u2019s revolutionary portraiture, eagerly purchasing new prints for their collections.

The 10 architects reflect a cross section of Chicago\\u2019s vibrant architectural scene\\u2014from large and small firms as well as the academic community\\u2014bringing to this exhibition diverse experiences and insights. Each architect was asked to define an important issue for the future of Chicago and create a \\u201cspatial commentary\\u201d on that particular theme. Within a lively plan designed by Stanley Tigerman, each of the participants has curated and designed his or her own mini-exhibition in a space of approximately 21 feet square. Tigerman\\u2019s setting creates a linear sequence in which visitors pass through the architects\\u2019 spaces to an interactive area where the architects\\u2019 commentaries can be heard by picking up a telephone.

As a boy he recorded his family\\u2019s European travels in sketchbooks, and as his talent and repertoire grew, he acquired numerous accoutrements such as portable easels, sketching umbrellas, rigid pads of paper, and compact palettes of watercolors that allowed him to paint multiple pictures during one outing, even in challenging conditions. In fact, Sargent was an official war artist for Britain during World War I and spent four months on the front painting and sketching.  A fellow war artist, Henry Tonks, painted this watercolor caricature of Sargent in 1918, depicting the artist clothed in army greens and shielded by a sketching umbrella that Sargent camouflaged for the purpose. The painting (held in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and not a part of this exhibition) gives new meaning to challenging conditions\\u2014and shows us a glimpse of Sargent\\u2019s life apart from glamorous portraits.  In preparation for the current exhibition John Singer Sargent and Chicago\\u2019s Gilded Age , Art Institute curators, conservators, and conservation scientists examined some of Sargent\\u2019s paintings and investigated his less obvious materials, finding evidence that provides valuable insight into the artist\\u2019s working process. A Newsworthy Surprise Sargent captured hundreds of landscapes in watercolor as he traveled across Europe and North America. In 1908 he painted Tarragona Terrace and Garden when he visited the eastern coast of Spain. Seated in the arcade of Tarragona\\u2019s cathedral, Sargent made a quick study of its columns.  While he generally preferred to leave parts of the paper bare to delineate highlights, the foliage in the upper left corner of this picture was painted using a different technique. Here it appears that Sargent simply laid in a mass of greens and browns and then returned with an opaque, zinc white paint to create his highlights. In order to fully conceal the dark colors underneath, Sargent had to use thick dabs of white as if he were making a correction in oils. Sargent often made multiple paintings in one day and would interleave his paintings with sheets of newspaper for protection as he carried them. He did this with Tarragona Terrace and Garden , perhaps not realizing that the thickly applied areas of paint had not dried completely when he laid the newspaper on its surface. As an unintended consequence, fragments from a Spanish newspaper stuck to the painting, remnants of Sargent\\u2019s panting process that survive today.  In normal light these tiny pieces of newsprint are barely noticeable, but they stand out in an infrared photograph, which makes some of the Spanish text almost legible.  Wax in a Watercolor Nearly 10 years after he painted Tarragona Terrace and Garden , Sargent made another series of stunning architectural studies while visiting his friends Charles and James Deering in Florida. Sargent was drawn to Vizcaya, the lavish estate that James had recently built, not least of all because it reminded him of the Italian landscapes and gardens that he loved to paint.  Analytical instruments in the conservation science lab at the Art Institute can help answer a lot of questions about artists\\u2019 materials. In the case of this work, scientists sought more information about a soft, translucent material found in discrete areas on its surface. The material was analyzed and determined to be a wax, which Sargent used as a \\u201cresist\\u201d\\u2014meaning that he marked the paper with a transparent material that would repel the water-based paint and leave highlights in the composition.  Analysis also revealed that the wax is a type called spermaceti, a product obtained from sperm whales and a major commercial product of the whaling industry. In Sargent\\u2019s time this wax was commonly used to make candles. Finding it here helps to explain Sargent\\u2019s process\\u2014because spermaceti is softer than other common waxes such as beeswax, it would have been the logical choice for use as a drawing material. To learn more about Sargent\\u2019s process and materials come visit John Singer Sargent and Chicago\\u2019s Gilded Age in the Art Institute\\u2019s Regenstein Hall through September 30, and check out the technical essay in the exhibition catalogue . \\u2014Mary Broadway, associate conservator of prints and drawings \",\n      \"source_updated_at\": \"2018-08-08T11:04:54-05:00\",\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 620,\n      \"api_model\": \"articles\",\n      \"api_link\": \"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/articles/620\",\n      \"title\": \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\",\n      \"copy\": \" There\\u2019s more than initially meets the eye to this exceptionally intricate lock, which was forged in iron by metalworker Frank Koralewsky and illustrates a scene from Grimms\\u2019 \\u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarves.\\u201d  Look closely and you\\u2019ll probably see Snow White first\\u2014she\\u2019s stirring a cauldron over a fire in the cottage\\u2019s kitchen.

So, here are some \\u201csecrets\\u201d of the Modern Wing. The building that now sits on Monroe Street is actually the third version of the expansion that the museum planned. We started thinking about expanding in 1999, before Millennium Park was built. So the original idea was to put the expansion on the south side of the building, over the railroad tracks. But once Millennium Park started to become more than parking lots, broken bottles, and train tracks, the architect Renzo Piano and museum leaders decided to completely reorient the building to face north. This move was made in 2001. To \\u201ctalk\\u201d to the park, and to test some proportional ideas for the fa\\u00e7ade, Piano designed the two Exelon Pavilions across the street from the Modern Wing. You may know these pavilions as the entrances to the parking garages under the park. Same materials, same ideas as those for the Modern Wing. Modest structures, big architect.  A guiding principle for the Modern Wing is Piano\\u2019s idea of \\u201czero gravity\\u201d\\u2014that buildings should appear to levitate and lift. I had always heard about this idea, and I sense it when I\\u2019m in the building, but it was never quite sure of how the details\\u2014beyond lots of verticals\\u2014worked. But the key to it in the Modern Wing is that everything is designed to not quite meet the floor. Every wall has a one-inch \\u201creveal\\u201d at the bottom of it. Piano designed all the benches, and they all sit slightly up off the floor on little pegs.  Every sculpture pedestal and platform also sit up off the floor. The main staircase also \\u201cfloats,\\u201d with an inch between what appears to be its base and the floor. Tiny detail, huge impact.

One of the most iconic examples of Picasso\\u2019s early Cubism, this portrait of the artist\\u2019s dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1884\\u20131979) was created over more than 30 working sessions. With each sitting, Picasso further broke down and recombined the forms he saw, eventually arriving at a depiction of Kahnweiler as a network of shimmering, semitransparent surfaces that fracture into different planes and shapes.  One of Germany\\u2019s leading modern painters, Gabrielle M\\u00fcnter was known for her use of saturated color and loose brushwork verging on abstraction. Often using toys as the subjects of her still lifes, she infused her work with a liveliness and wit. Here, her painting includes a depiction of a wax doll made by her friend, the Russian dancer Alexander Sacharoff.  In his seminal 1912 publication, Concerning the Spiritual in Art , Vasily Kandinsky advocated an art that could move beyond imitation of the physical world, inspiring, as he put it, \\\"vibrations in the soul.\\u201d Improvisation No. 30 (Cannons) \\u2014one of the first works in which he attempted to depict those \\u201cvibrations\\u201d \\u2014 is a standout work within the Art Institute\\u2019s modern art collection, which includes five key paintings by Kandinsky.  This monumental painting is the result of an intense period of experimentation and revision for artist Henri Matisse. He originally painted the work as a pastoral scene of standing and seated bathers, but over the next decade he transformed it into the cubist-inflected composition seen today. When the painting was acquired by the Art Institute in 1953, Matisse told the museum\\u2019s director that he viewed the painting as one of his five most pivotal works.  In 1913, on a transatlantic voyage to New York, Francis Picabia was amused by two fellow passengers: an exotic dancer and a Dominican priest, who could not resist the temptation of watching the dancer rehearse. In response, Picabia created this monumental canvas that evokes the sensations of dance and a ship moving through rolling seas. He titled the work Edtaonisl , an acronym made by alternating the letters of the French words \\u00e9toile (star) and dans[e] (dance).  Among the most influential images in the early history of Surrealism, Giorgio de Chirico\\u2019s The Philosopher\\u2019s Conquest seems rife with meaning yet remains resolutely enigmatic. By juxtaposing incongruous objects, the artist sought to produce what he called art that resembles \\u201cthe restlessness of myth.\\u201d De Chirico\\u2019s works profoundly affected artists associated with the Surrealist movement, who in the 1920s and 1930s used similarly unconventional pairings to explore the realm of the subconscious in their work.  While working in Russia in 1915, Kazimir Malevich invented Suprematism, a revolutionary mode of abstraction, which he considered a new type of realism. Breaking away from observed reality to focus instead on the relationships between colored geometric forms against a textured white background, the artist freed his compositions from traditional givens\\u2014like top or bottom, left or right\\u2014and presented everyday scenes, such as an athlete playing soccer, as if they existed in four dimensions.  Among the earliest proponents of abstract painting in Europe, Frantisek Kupka immigrated from Bohemia (in present-day Czech Republic) to Paris in 1896. Traveling to Paris and Chartres, France, he studied the stained-glass windows of Gothic and Romanesque cathedrals and created radiant abstractions that convey the feeling of light passing through colored glass.  Functioning simultaneously as an abstract painting and a concrete poem, Suzanne Duchamp\\u2019s Broken and Restored Multiplication is filled with visual and verbal metaphors of disorder and breakage. In this collage-like array, she turns the iconic metal lattice of the Eiffel Tower upside-down, alerting us to the fragility, but also the flexibility, of systems such as language and memory that allow us to recognize our place in the world, even as it seems to be falling apart.  Constantin Br\\u00e2ncu\\u0219i's Golden Bird is an icon of modern sculpture and one of more than two dozen Bird sculptures the artist created in his quest for self-sufficient form. As Br\\u00e2ncu\\u0219i once said, \\u201cAll my life, I have sought to render the essence of flight.\\u201d In this work, details such as feet, a tail, and an upturned beak are barely suggested, and the elegant, streamlined silhouette of the polished bronze contrasts the rough-hewn wood base.  Piet Mondrian, a founding member of the revolutionary international movement De Stijl (the Style), argued that \\u201cthe straight line tells the truth.\\u201d Deceptively simple, his works are the result of constant adjustment to achieve absolute balance and harmony. In Lozenge Composition with Yellow, Black, Blue, Red, and Gray , Mondrian rotated a square canvas 90-degrees to create a dynamic relationship between the rectilinear composition and the diagonal lines of the edges of the support.  One of the most prolific artists of the 20th century, Picasso arguably influenced the direction of modern art more than any other single figure. In this work, a portrait of Marie-Th\\u00e9r\\u00e8se Walter, he used an approach inflected by both Cubism and Surrealism, depicting Walter\\u2019s face from a frontal and profile view simultaneously.  Although Marcel Duchamp began his career as a painter, he is best known for his attempts to prove the end of \\u201cretinal art,\\u201d or artworks created to please the eye. His answer was the \\u201creadymade,\\u201d an ordinary object transformed into a work of art simply by means of its selection and designation as such by an artist. His Bottle Rack , first realized in 1914, is the earliest work of this type, and was acquired by the Art Institute in 2018. Learn more about Duchamp\\u2019s Bottle Rack on the museum\\u2019s blog .  Among the boldest and the most brilliantly colored of all of Max Beckmann\\u2019s self-portraits, this was perhaps the last painting the artist completed in Berlin before he and his wife fled to the Netherlands\\u2014just two days after Adolf Hitler delivered a speech condemning modern art. In 1937, shortly after this work was made, more than 500 of his works were confiscated from German public collections.  White Crucifixion represents a critical turning point for Marc Chagall and for the history of 20th-century art: it was the first of a series of compositions in which the artist portrayed Christ as a Jewish martyr and identified the Nazis with Christ\\u2019s tormentors. Painted in response to the terror and trauma of Kristallnacht, an anti-Jewish pogrom, this work is among the most overtly political paintings of Chagall\\u2019s career. \",\n      \"source_updated_at\": \"2020-05-28T06:33:12-05:00\",\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 6,\n      \"api_model\": \"highlights\",\n      \"api_link\": \"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/highlights/6\",\n      \"title\": \"american-art\",\n      \"copy\": \" Please note: artworks occasionally go off view for imaging, treatment, or loan to other institutions.

She started a series of paintings inspired by her in-flight experiences. The works began small and progressively got bigger until the final canvas in the series, Sky above Clouds IV , which is so large that it has never traveled since coming to the Art Institute.  One of America's most famous paintings, American Gothic , debuted at the Art Institute of Chicago, winning a $300 prize and instant fame for Grant Wood. It has long been parodied and is often seen as a satirical commentary on the Midwestern character, but Wood intended it to a positive statement about rural American values. Read more about this work on our blog, where a curator answers the top five FAQs about the iconic painting.  One of the best-known images of 20th-century art, Nighthawks depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost in their own thoughts, have congregated. It's unclear how or why the anonymous and uncommunicative night owls are there\\u2014in fact, Hopper eliminated any reference to an entrance to the diner. The four seem as separate and remote from the viewer as they are from one another. (The red-haired woman was actually modeled by the artist\\u2019s wife, Jo.)  Known today for his paintings and murals depicting Mexican political and cultural life, Diego Rivera enjoyed a brief but sparkling period as a Cubist painter early in his career. In this work he portrayed his then-lover, the Russian-born painter and writer Marevna Vorob\\u00ebv-Stebelska, clearly conveying her distinctive bobbed hair, blond bangs, and prominent nose\\u2014despite or with the aid of the Cubist style. Like many other artists in Paris, Rivera rejected Cubism as frivolous and inappropriate following World War I and the Russian Revolution.  A native Chicagoan and graduate of the School of the Art Institute, Archibald Motley used his art to represent the vibrancy of African American culture, frequently portraying young, sophisticated city dwellers out on the town. One of Motley\\u2019s most celebrated paintings, Nightlife depicts a crowded cabaret in the South Side neighborhood of Bronzeville. The dynamic composition, intense lighting, and heightened colors vividly express the liveliness of the scene.  The only American artist invited to exhibit with the French Impressionists, Mary Cassatt concentrated on the human figure, particularly on sensitive yet unsentimental portrayals of women and children. In The Child\\u2019s Bath , one of Cassatt\\u2019s masterworks, she used cropped forms, bold patterns and outlines, and a flattened perspective, all of which she derived from her study of Japanese woodblock prints.  Eldzier Cortor lived in Chicago and attended the School of the Art Institute, and while drawn to abstraction, he felt that it was not an effective tool for conveying serious social and political concerns. In The Room No. VI, the artist exposes the impoverished living conditions experienced by many African Americans on the South Side through a brilliant use of line and color, reinvigorating the idiom of social realism.  Though Stuart Davis studied with the so-called Ashcan School, who sought to depict a realistic look at modern urban life, he came to embrace a more abstracted and energetic style, as seen in Ready-to-Wear . The bright colors intersect and interrupt one another in a distinctly American way: jazzy, vital, and mass produced\\u2014all qualities summed up in the title.  In addition to architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright designed furniture like this chair from his home in Oak Park, Illinois. Though his early experiments were heavy, solid cube chairs, he eventually added the refinements seen in this design, such as spindles, the subtly tapering crest rail, and gently curving leg ends, all of which produce an effect that is equal parts sophistication and simplicity.  In The Herring Net, Winslow Homer depicts two fishermen at their daily yet heroic work. As the small boat rides the swells, one fisherman hauls in the heavy net while the other unloads the glistening herring, illustrating that teamwork is essential for survival on this churning sea that both gives and takes. \",\n      \"source_updated_at\": \"2020-05-28T06:32:54-05:00\",\n      ...\n    }\n  ],\n  \"info\": {\n    \"license_text\": \"The data in this response may be protected by copyright, and other restrictions, of the Art Institute of Chicago and third parties.

One of the most famous American paintings of all time, this double portrait by Grant Wood debuted at the Art Institute in 1930, winning the artist a $300 prize and instant fame. Many people think the couple are a husband and wife, but Wood meant the couple to be a father and his daughter. (His sister and his dentist served as his models.) He intended this Depression-era canvas to be a positive statement about rural American values during a time of disillusionment. See American Gothic on view in Gallery 263.  For his largest and best-known painting, Georges Seurat depicted Parisians enjoying all sorts of leisurely activities\\u2014strolling, lounging, sailing, and fishing\\u2014in the park called La Grande Jatte in the River Seine. He used an innovative technique called Pointillism, inspired by optical and color theory, applying tiny dabs of different colored paint that viewers see as a single, and Seurat believed, more brilliant hue. See this work on view in Gallery 240.  Hero Construction , created in 1958, just a year after Chicago sculptor Richard Hunt graduated from the School of the Art Institute, is composed of found objects\\u2014old pipes, bits of metal, and automobile parts\\u2014that the artist discovered in junkyards and on the street. Inspired by mythology and heroic sculptures past and present, the welded figure suggests a hero for our times, humble yet resilient in the face of past, present, and future injustices and uncertainties. See Hero Construction on view on the Woman's Board Grand Staircase.  This iconic painting of an all-night diner in which three customers sit together and yet seem totally isolated from one another has become one of the best-known images of 20th-century art. Hopper said of the enigmatic work, \\u201cUnconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city.\\u201d See Nighthawks on view in Gallery 262.  In the 1970s, Alma Thomas was enthralled by astronauts and outer space. Starry Night and the Astronauts not only captures her fascination with space flight but also shows the signature style of her abstract works, which use short, rhythmic strokes of paint. \\u201cColor is life,\\u201d she once proclaimed, \\u201cand light is the mother of color.\\u201d Thomas made this work in 1972, when she was 81\\u2014the same year she became the first African American woman to have a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. See Starry Night and the Astronauts in Gallery 291.  Pablo Picasso\\u2019s The Old Guitarist is a work from his Blue Period (1901\\u201304). During this time the artist restricted himself to a cold, monochromatic blue palette and flattened forms, taking on the themes of misery and alienation inspired by such artists as Edvard Munch and Paul Gauguin. The elongated, angular figure also relates to Picasso\\u2019s interest in Spanish art and, in particular, the great 16th-century artist El Greco . The image re\\ufb02ects the 22-year-old Picasso\\u2019s personal sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden; he knew what it was like to be poor, having been nearly penniless during all of 1902. See The Old Guitarist on view in Gallery 391.  Over his short five-year career, Vincent van Gogh painted 35 self-portraits\\u201424 of them, including this early example, during his two-year stay in Paris with his brother Theo. Here, Van Gogh used densely dabbed brushwork, an approach influenced by Georges Seurat\\u2019s revolutionary technique in A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\\u20141884 (on view Gallery in 240), to create a dynamic portrayal of himself. The dazzling array of dots and dashes in brilliant greens, blues, reds, and oranges is anchored by his intense gaze. See Van Gogh's Self-Portrait on view in Gallery 241.  Caught in the heat of battle with sword raised and horse rearing, this mounted figure may match many notions of a knight in shining armor but actually represents a common hired soldier. The armors for both man and horse were produced in Nuremberg, Germany, in the 16th century, but the clothing was meticulously recreated in 2017 from period designs. Look for the special leggings: small plates of steel are sewn between two pieces of linen to protect the soldier's legs. You'll also spot some splashes of mud and grime from the battlefield. See Field Armor for Man and Horse on view in Gallery 239.  The densely painted and geometrically patterned Kuba mask is a ngady mwaash , an idealized representation of a woman that honors the role of women in Kuba life. Ngady mwaah most often appear as part of a trio of royal masks in reenactments of the Kuba Kingdom\\u2019s origins, which are staged at public ceremonies, initiations, and funerals. In these masquerades, the ngady mwaash dances together with the mooshamb-wooy mask, which represents the king (who is both her brother and her husband), and the bwoom mask. Male mask characters like bwoom display aggression and heaviness while female characters like ngady mwaash dance in a sensuous and graceful manner even though the mask is always worn by a man. See this ngady mwaash on view in Gallery 137.  This 12th-century statue of the Buddha comes from the south Indian coastal town of Nagapattinam, where Buddhist monasteries flourished and attracted monks from distant lands. He is seated in a lotus posture of meditation, with hands and feet resting atop one another. The mark on his forehead is called the urna, which distinguishes the Buddha as a great being. See this work on view in Gallery 140.  A native Chicagoan and graduate of the School of the Art Institute, Archibald Motley used his art to represent the vibrancy of African American culture, frequently portraying young, sophisticated city dwellers out on the town. One of Motley\\u2019s most celebrated paintings, Nightlife depicts a crowded cabaret in the South Side neighborhood of Bronzeville. The dynamic composition, intense lighting, and heightened colors vividly express the liveliness of the scene. See Nightlife in Gallery 263.  Painted in the summer of 1965, when Georgia O'Keeffe was 77 years old, this monumental work culminates the artist\\u2019s series based on her experiences as an airplane passenger during the 1950s. Spanning the entire 24-foot width of O\\u2019Keeffe\\u2019s garage, the work has not left the Art Institute since it came into the building\\u2014because of its size and because of its status as an essential icon. See Sky above Clouds IV on view in Gallery 249.  More than 100 years ago, Agnes F. Northrop designed the monumental Hartwell Memorial Window for Tiffany Studios as a commission from Mary Hartwell in honor of her husband, Frederick Hartwell, for the Central Baptist Church of Providence, Rhode Island (now Community Church of Providence). Composed of 48 panels and numerous different glass types, the window is inspired by the view from Frederick Hartwell\\u2019s family home near Mt. Chocorua in New Hampshire. The majestic scene captures the transitory beauty of nature\\u2014the sun setting over a mountain, flowing water, and dappled light dancing through the trees\\u2014in an intricate arrangement of vibrantly colored glass. See the Hartwell Memorial Window on view at the top of the Woman's Board Grand Staircase. \",\n    \"source_updated_at\": \"2023-02-22T05:20:55-06:00\",\n    ...\n  },\n  \"info\": {\n    \"license_text\": \"The data in this response may be protected by copyright, and other restrictions, of the Art Institute of Chicago and third parties.

Born in Mozambique, in southeast Africa, Malangatana depicted vivid allegorical scenes that draw from local religious practices, his cultural background, and life under colonial rule. This exhibition presented a selection of the artist\\u2019s early paintings and drawings, made between 1959 and 1975. During this period Malangatana embarked on bold formal experiments that coalesced into a signature style characterized by dense compositions of human, animal, and monstrous figures. Malangatana\\u2019s early career coincided with Mozambique\\u2019s liberation struggle, in particular the armed resistance against the Portuguese in 1964, which was spearheaded by the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). A Portuguese colony until 1975, Mozambique was among the last countries on the African continent to gain independence. Malangatana explored the rapidly changing world around him and addressed the country\\u2019s social and political context in his paintings and drawings. These works exemplify the confluence of artistic innovation and political liberation that has shaped the history of modern art in Africa during the second half of the twentieth century.  A Hybrid Education Growing up in the village of Matalana, Malangatana encountered local art and craft traditions such as pottery, basketry, and painting before moving to Mozambique\\u2019s capital, Louren\\u00e7o Marques (now Maputo), to find work. Racial and social barriers of the colonial system limited black Mozambicans\\u2019 access to formal art education. However, colonial policies promoting integration through assimilation\\u2014pressuring the local black population to adopt the language, religion, and values of the Portuguese\\u2014made art classes available to Malangatana at the Industrial School as well as the Art Center of the Colony of Mozambique in the late 1950s. At the Art Center, Malangatana encountered European styles of painting and met Portuguese architect Am\\u00e2ncio d\\u2019Alpoim Miranda \\u201cPancho\\u201d Guedes, who became a significant mentor and patron. Guedes encouraged him to leave the Art Center in order to avoid, in Malangatana\\u2019s words, \\u201cpollution\\u201d by a formal education anchored in European painting traditions. Guedes gave Malangatana studio space and a salary, and commissioned a large number of paintings in the years prior to the artist\\u2019s first solo exhibition in 1961.  Mythology and Religion Many of Malangatana\\u2019s works from the late 1950s to the early 1970s refer to the artist\\u2019s Mozambican roots, specifically his Ronga cultural background. The paintings in this section feature Ronga folklore, mythology, and healing rituals. Frequently the artist included Catholic symbols, signs of the pervasive Portuguese influence in Mozambique. Malangatana\\u2019s exaggerated depictions of Ronga culture verge on the satirical, and his references to Christianity are similarly unflattering, suggesting a critique of Portuguese colonial rule. Malangatana\\u2019s work demonstrates how he carefully balanced all aspects of life in Mozambique, from colonial influences and indigenous customs and practices to the struggle for independence. These experiences\\u2014as well as his art education and the structures of patronage he was embedded in\\u2014were layered and complex, subverting the clich\\u00e9d notion of the self-taught African artist who, unspoiled by foreign influences, finds inspiration in \\u201cprimitive\\u201d practices and beliefs, an idea that persists in the art history and reception of modern African art.  Beyond Painting and Drawing Malangatana was also active as an educator, muralist, sculptor, and writer. He frequently published in journals and corresponded extensively with peers and friends all over the world. In addition, he wrote poetry, at times to accompany his paintings. Malangatana drew from personal aspects of his life in his poems, some of which were presented in an issue of the African literary journal Black Orpheus.  In 1995 Malangatana started building a cultural center in his birth village of Matalana to host art education and community events. The center\\u2019s architecture combines the geometric logic and industrial materials of Bauhaus design\\u2014inspired by the work of Malangatana\\u2019s friend and patron Pancho Guedes, a renowned modern architect\\u2014with elements such as circular windows, teeth, grids, and figurative wall reliefs (fig. 1). The grid design of this exhibition borrowed from the center\\u2019s architecture (fig. 2).  Prison Drawings In 1965\\u201366 the International and State Defense Police (PIDE) imprisoned Malangatana for 18 months because of his suspected involvement with the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). While incarcerated, the artist began a series of drawings that he continued to work on after his release. The works capture the harsh conditions of life in Machava Central Prison through striking realism interrupted by fantasy scenes and dreams, their tension amplified by distorted bodies and monstrous figures. In 1961 mentor and patron Pancho Guedes introduced Malangatana to Eduardo Chivambo Mondlane, the founding president of the movement FRELIMO. Malangatana hoped to go abroad for international opportunities and exposure, but Mondlane encouraged him to stay in Mozambique and use art to contribute to the anti-colonial struggle. The artist\\u2019s growing political awareness during the 1960s is apparent in the increasingly political tone of his work. He also expressed dissent by withdrawing from the 1964 exhibition Artists in Mozambique to protest Nelson Mandela\\u2019s imprisonment and by refusing to represent Portugal at the 1965 S\\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial.  Artist of the Revolution After receiving a yearlong scholarship in 1971 from the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon, Malangatana explored new media and pursued exhibition opportunities across Europe\\u2014before returning permanently to Mozambique in 1974. There he continued experimenting in his art by elongating limbs, introducing opaque colors, and moving further into abstraction with thick outlines and flattened compositions. The titles of his works during this period, such as The Cry for Freedom and Remember Those Who Entered Bleeding? , reflect the focus on the war for independence and the sense of urgency Mozambicans felt at the time: in 1974 a ceasefire ended the war, followed by ten months of negotiations and the country\\u2019s independence on June 25, 1975. After independence Malangatana was embraced as an artist of the revolution, and his work, including state-funded murals, was recognized as an exemplar of Mozambican culture. In addition to holding multiple roles within the newly formed government, he was appointed ambassador of peace during Mozambique\\u2019s civil war (1977\\u201392) and UNESCO Artist for Peace in 1997. He was also instrumental in establishing Mozambique\\u2019s National Museum of Art in Maputo. Malangatana continued working as a civic leader, educator, poet, and, foremost, as an artist until his death in 2011. \",\n      ...\n    }\n  ],\n  \"info\": {\n    \"license_text\": \"The data in this response may be protected by copyright, and other restrictions, of the Art Institute of Chicago and third parties.

In that spirit, a number of our curators came together in 2013 for a series of discussions exploring ideas about modern art, in particular the ways in which it manifests across our collections. This gave rise to the Modern Series, a set of three experimental, challenging, and provocative exhibitions and publications that are co-organized by curators across departments, with divergent but complementary specialties. The two previous iterations\\u2014 Shatter Rupture Break (February 15\\u2013May 3, 2015) and Go (February 23\\u2013June 4, 2017)\\u2014sought to present the museum\\u2019s holdings in departments including Arts of the Americas, Modern and Contemporary Art, Photography and Media, and Textiles in fresh and exciting ways. Malangatana: Mozambique Modern (July 30\\u2013November 16, 2020), the third and final project in the series, expands our understanding of modernism and modern art in a global context by bringing the work of celebrated Mozambican artist Malangatana Ngwenya (1936\\u20132011) into conversation with our own international collection. It not only showcases the evolution in style and content within his early paintings and drawings, but also contextualizes his practice within the social and political conditions that framed the emergence of modern art in Mozambique and across the African continent. The exhibition also contributed to the cultivation of a more global perspective on artistic creation and its representation in the museum, both by providing the basis for this publication and, not least, by prompting us to acquire a painting and six works on paper by Malangatana for our permanent collection. Africa and its diasporas, with their deep history and wide geographical reach, occupy a prominent place within global art history and modern art that merits many more such efforts and programs in the years to come. Our colleagues\\u2014notably Sarah Guernsey, Ann Goldstein, and Greg Nosan\\u2014deserve my sincere gratitude for their continuing critical support for the Modern Series. But I am especially thankful to the exhibition\\u2019s curators, Hendrik Folkerts, Felicia Mings, and Constantine Petridis, for introducing our staff and visitors to the fascinating milieu and work of Malangatana Ngwenya and for helping the Art Institute expand its representation of modern art from around the world. This exhibition would not have been possible without the generosity of the individuals and institutions in the United States, Portugal, and Mozambique who lent works from their collections. I am particularly grateful to the Malangatana Valente Ngwenya Foundation in Maputo for its invaluable loan of a significant number of paintings and drawings. Major funding for Malangatana: Mozambique Modern was provided by Sylvia Neil and Dan Fischel and the Alfred L. McDougal and Nancy Lauter McDougal Fund for Contemporary Art. Additional support is contributed by the Society for Contemporary Art through the SCA Activation Fund and the Miriam U. Hoover Foundation. Members of the Luminary Trust provide annual leadership support for the museum\\u2019s operations, including exhibition development, conservation and collection care, and educational programming. The Luminary Trust includes an anonymous donor; Neil Bluhm and the Bluhm Family Charitable Foundation; Jay Franke and David Herro; Karen Gray-Krehbiel and John Krehbiel, Jr.; Kenneth Griffin; Caryn and King Harris, The Harris Family Foundation; Josef and Margot Lakonishok; Robert M. and Diane v.S. Levy; Ann and Samuel M. Mencoff; Sylvia Neil and Dan Fischel; Anne and Chris Reyes; Cari and Michael J. Sacks; and the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation. Most importantly, I acknowledge with deepest thanks the intellectual and financial support of Sylvia Neil and Dan Fischel, who have provided crucial funding for the realization of this catalogue as well as the previous two in the Modern Series. Their ongoing commitment has enabled and encouraged our continued explorations into the possibilities of digital publication. James Rondeau President and Eloise W.

This important volume, illustrated with more than one hundred vivid images, offers a new, in-depth look at the Pushtimarg and its rich aesthetic traditions, which are largely unknown outside of South Asia. Original essays by eminent scholars of Indian art focus on the style of worship, patterns of patronage, and artistic heritage that generated pichvais , large paintings on cloth designed to hang in temples, as well as other paintings for the Pushtimarg. In this expansive study, the authors deftly examine how pichvais were and still are used in the seasonal and daily veneration of Shrinathji, an aspect of Krishna as a child who is the chief deity of the temple town of Nathdwara in Rajasthan. Gates of the Lord introduces readers not only to the visual world of the Pushtimarg but also to the spirit of Nathdwara.

We all know what a face looks like, but no two faces are exactly alike. In works of art, we find an endless parade of faces. They can help us discover how people from different cultures and times have seen themselves.  Just like faces, places are full of variety. The word \\\"place\\\" can mean anything from the corner of a drawer to a neighborhood, from a kitchen to a forest, from a backyard to the moon! By looking at landscapes and cityscapes, interiors and exteriors, we can become more aware of our everyday life and appreciate what surrounds us.  Faces and places are all around us, but what about inner spaces? Inner spaces can be found in our minds, private places created by our emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and imagination. Artists who depict their dreams or fantasies share something very personal that might resemble some of our own thoughts, or seem so strange that we want to know more.  All of the art featured in Faces, Places, and Inner Spaces is from the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, which houses more than 300,000 works within its 11 curatorial departments. This book includes such world-famous treasures as A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\\u20141884 by Georges Seurat and American Gothic by Grant Wood.

Use of this API does not require a API Key, just generate the URL below use it in your own application to retrieve trivia questions.\nAll data provided by the API is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. [![](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/4.0/80x15.png)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\nAPI Documentation\n### Getting Started\nTo get started using the Open Trivia DB API, use this URL: For more settings or help using the API, read along below. Alternatively, you can use the helper form to craft your specific query. \n### Session Tokens\nSession Tokens are unique keys that will help keep track of the questions the API has already retrieved. By appending a Session Token to a API Call, the API will never give you the same question twice. Over the lifespan of a Session Token, there will eventually reach a point where you have exhausted all the possible questions in the database. At this point, the API will respond with the approperate \"Response Code\". From here, you can either \"Reset\" the Token, which will wipe all past memory, or you can ask for a new one. _**Session Tokens will be deleted after 6 hours of inactivity.**_\nUsing a Session Token: \nRetrieve a Session Token: \nReset a Session Token: \n### Response Codes\nThe API appends a \"Response Code\" to each API Call to help tell developers what the API is doing. \n  * Code 0: **Success** Returned results successfully.\n  * Code 1: **No Results** Could not return results. The API doesn't have enough questions for your query. (Ex. Asking for 50 Questions in a Category that only has 20.)\n  * Code 2: **Invalid Parameter** Contains an invalid parameter. Arguements passed in aren't valid. (Ex. Amount = Five)\n  * Code 3: **Token Not Found** Session Token does not exist.\n  * Code 4: **Token Empty** Session Token has returned all possible questions for the specified query. Resetting the Token is necessary.\n  * Code 5: **Rate Limit** Too many requests have occurred. Each IP can only access the API once every 5 seconds.\n\n\n### Encoding Types\nThe Open Trivia DB may contain questions which contain Unicode or Special Characters. For this reason, the API returns results in a encoded format. You can specify the desired encoding format using the examples below. If the encode type is not present in the URL, it will follow the default encoding. \nAPI Call with Encode Type (urlLegacy, url3986, base64): \nExample Sentence (Non Encoded): \"Don't forget that π = 3.14 & doesn't equal 3.\" \n  * **Default Encoding (HTML Codes):**\n  * **Legacy URL Encoding:**\n  * **URL Encoding ([RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt)):**\n  * **Base64 Encoding:**\n\n\n### Helper API Tools\nThere are some functions in the API which can be useful to developers. \n**Category Lookup:** Returns the entire list of categories and ids in the database. \n**Category Question Count Lookup:** Returns the number of questions in the database, in a specific category. \n**Global Question Count Lookup:** Returns the number of ALL questions in the database. Total, Pending, Verified, and Rejected. \n### Limitations\n  * Only 1 Category can be requested per API Call. To get questions from any category, don't specify a category.\n  * A Maximum of 50 Questions can be retrieved per call.\n\n\n## API Helper\nNumber of Questions: Select Category:  Any Category General KnowledgeEntertainment: BooksEntertainment: FilmEntertainment: MusicEntertainment: Musicals & TheatresEntertainment: TelevisionEntertainment: Video GamesEntertainment: Board GamesScience & NatureScience: ComputersScience: MathematicsMythologySportsGeographyHistoryPoliticsArtCelebritiesAnimalsVehiclesEntertainment: ComicsScience: GadgetsEntertainment: Japanese Anime & MangaEntertainment: Cartoon & Animations Select Difficulty:  Any Difficulty Easy Medium Hard Select Type:  > Any Type Multiple Choice True / False Select Encoding:  > Default Encoding Legacy URL Encoding URL Encoding (RFC 3986) Base64 Encoding Generate API URL\n",

Unlike the [List Quotes](https://quotable.io#list-quotes) endpoint, this method is powered by [Atlas Search](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/) and is designed to power a search bar UI.\n  * Search results are sorted by score\n  * The query can be wrapped in quotes to search for an exact phrase. In this case, results will only include quotes that match the query exactly.\n  * Supports fuzzy search (optional). This allows for minor typos and misspelling in the search query. For more info on how this works, refer to the [Atlas docs](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/atlas-search/text/#fields)\n\n\n**Query Params**\nParam | Type | Description  \n---|---|---  \nquery | `String` | The search string. The query can be wrapped in quotes to search for an exact phrase.  \nfields | `String` | `Default: \"content,author,tags\"` Specify the fields to search by. This takes a comma separated list of field names. Supported search fields are \"content\", \"author\", \"tags\". By default, it will search by all fields simultaneously.  \nfuzzyMaxEdits | `Int` | `Min: 0` `Max: 2` `Default: 0` The maximum number of single-character edits required to match the specified search term. Setting this to zero disables fuzzy matching.  \nfuzzyMaxExpansions | `Int` | `Max: 150` `Min: 0` `Default: 50` When fuzzy search is enabled, this is the maximum number of variations to generate and search for. This limit applies on a per-token basis.  \nlimit | `Int` | `Min: 0` `Max: 150` `Default: 20` The maximum number of results per page  \npage | `Int` | `Min: 1` `Default: 1` Sets the page number for pagination  \n**Response**\n```\n{\n // The number of results included in this response.\n count: number\n // The total number of results matching this request.\n totalCount: number\n // The current page number\n page: number\n // The total number of pages matching this request\n totalPages: number\n // The 1-based index of the last result included in this response.

It is designed to power a search bar for authors that displays autocomplete suggests as the user types.\n  * Powered by [Atlas Search](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/).\n  * Real autocomplete\n  * Results are sorted by score\n  * Parses the query into \"terms\". Things like initials, prefixes, suffixes, and stopwords are not considered search terms. They will still impact the score of a result, but are not required to match.\n\n\n```\nExample\nquery=\"John F. Kennedy\"\nterms=[\"john\", \"kennedy\"]\n term   term\n |     |\nJohn F. Kennedy Jr.\n   |       |\n  initial    suffix\nExample\nquery=\"Saint Augustine of Hippo\"\nterms=[\"Augustine\", \"Hippo\"]\n    term    term\n     |     |\n Saint Augustine of Hippo\n  |       |\nprefix    stopword\n\n```\n\n**Query Parameters**\nParam | Type | Description  \n---|---|---  \nquery | `String` | The search query  \nautocomplete | `Boolean` | `default: true` Enables autocomplete matching  \nmatchThreshold | `Int` | `Min: 1` `Max: 3` `Default: 2` Sets the minimum number of search terms (words) that must match for an author to be included in results. Basically, if this is set to 1, the results will include all authors that match at least one part of the name. So query=\"John F. Kennedy\" the results would include all authors that match either \"john\" `OR` \"kennedy\". If this is set to `2`: when the search query includes two or more \"terms\", at least two of those terms must match. So query=\"John F. Kennedy\" would only return authors that match \"John\" `AND` \"Kennedy\".  \nlimit | `Int` | `Min: ` `Max: 150` `Default: 20` Maximum number of results per page  \npage | `Int` | `Min: 1` `Default: 1` Sets the page number for pagination  \n**Response**\n```\n{\n // The number of results included in this response.\n count: number\n // The total number of results matching this request.\n totalCount: number\n // The current page number\n page: number\n // The total number of pages matching this request\n totalPages: number\n // The 1-based index of the last result included in this response.

It allows filtering quotes by author, tags, length, and supports search operations. The base URL is `https://api.quotable.io`.\n\n**1. Get Random Quote**\n```python\nimport requests\nurl = \"https://api.quotable.io/quotes/random\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    # Process the JSON response here to extract random quote\n    # Example: print(f'\"{data[0][\"content\"]}\" - {data[0][\"author\"]}')\nelse:\n    print(f\"Request to {url} failed with status code: {response.status_code}\")\n```\n\n**2. Search Quotes by Keyword**\n```python\nimport requests\nurl = \"https://api.quotable.io/search/quotes\"\nparams = {\"query\": \"technology\", \"fields\": \"content\"}\nresponse = requests.get(url, params=params)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    # Process search results from data['results']\n    # Example: [quote['content'] for quote in data['results']]\nelse:\n    print(f\"Request to {url} failed with status code: {response.status_code}\")\n```\n\n**3. Get Author Details by Slug**\n```python\nimport requests\nurl = \"https://api.quotable.io/authors/slug/albert-einstein\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    # Access author bio and metadata\n    # Example: print(data['bio'])\nelse:\n    print(f\"Request to {url} failed with status code: {response.status_code}\")"

        "markdown": "[ ](https://api.stackexchange.com/)\n## Stack Exchange API v2.3\nThis is the documentation for the v2.3 Stack Exchange API (with both [authentication](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/authentication) and [write](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/write) support). If you have additional questions, or believe you have encountered a bug, don't hesitate to post a question on [Stack Apps](http://stackapps.com).\nIf your application is in a runnable state (even a beta one), Stack Apps is also the place to [list it](http://stackapps.com/questions/7/how-to-list-your-application-library-wrapper-here).\n## General\nApplications should be registered on [Stack Apps](http://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register) to get a request key. Request keys grant more requests per day, and are necessary for using access_tokens created via [authentication](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/authentication).\nAll API responses are [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), we do support [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) with the `callback` query parameter. Every response in the API is returned in a common [\"wrapper\" object](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/wrapper), for easier and more consistent parsing.\nAdditionally, all API responses are compressed. The `Content-Encoding` header is always set, but some proxies will strip this out. The proper way to decode API responses can be found [here](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/compression).\nAPI usage is subject to a [number of throttles](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/throttle). In general, applications should strive to make as few requests as possible to satisfy their function.\nAPI responses are heavily cached. Polling for changes should be done sparingly in any case, and polling at a rate faster than once a minute (for semantically identical requests) is considered abusive.\nDevelopers can trim API responses down to just the fields they are interested in using [custom filters](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/filters). Many types have fields that are not normally returned (question bodies, for example) that can likewise be requested via a custom filter.\nThere are a few methods which require that the application be acting on behalf of a user in order to be invoked. For authentication purposes, the Stack Exchange API [implements OAuth 2.0](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/authentication) (templated on Facebook's implementation in pursuit of developer familiarity).\nA number of methods in the Stack Exchange accept dates as parameters and return dates as properties, the format of these dates is [consistent and documented](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/dates). The cliff-notes version is, all dates in the Stack Exchange API are in [unix epoch time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).\nUnless otherwise noted, the maximum size of any page is `100`, any `{ids}` parameter likewise is capped at `100` elements, all indexes start at 1.\nThe maximum page number that will be returned for anonymous API access (no access token or app key) is 25\nIf a parameter name is plural it accepts [vectorized requests](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/vectors), otherwise a single value may be passed. Compare [users/{id}/inbox](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/user-inbox) and [/users/{ids}](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/users-by-ids).\nIt is possible to compose [reasonably complex queries](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/min-max) against the live Stack Exchange sites using the `min`, `max`, `fromdate`, `todate`, and `sort` parameters. Most, but not all, methods accept some or all of these parameters, the documentation for individual methods will highlight which do. Most methods also have a common set of [paging parameters](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/paging).\nSome methods require access_tokens with particular scopes, such as private_info ([/users/{id}/reputation-history/full](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/full-reputation-history) for example) or write_access ([/questions/add](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/create-question)). Certain fields require access_tokens with the private_info scope, such as answer.upvoted; the documentation for each time makes note of these fields.\n[by category](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs?tab=category#docs \"group by concept\") [by type](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs?tab=type#docs \"group by type\")\n## Per-Site Methods\nEach of these methods operates on a single site at a time, identified by the `site` parameter. This parameter can be the full domain name (ie. \"stackoverflow.com\"), or a short form identified by `api_site_parameter` on the [site object](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/types/site). \n###

Enjoy :) \n### API response format\nAll API endpoints follow their respective browser URLs, but we adjust the response formatting to be more suited for an API based on the provided HTTP `Accept` header. \nAccepted `Accept` headers: \n  * `text/html` - HTML response (default response format)\n  * `application/json` - JSON response\n  * `text/plain` - Plain text response\n\n**Note:** Requests made via `curl` which do not set an `Accept` header will respond with `text/plain` by default. \n### Custom user agent\nIf you intend on using the _icanhazdadjoke.com_ API we kindly ask that you set a custom `User-Agent` header for all requests. \nSetting a custom `User-Agent` header for your code will help us be able to better monitor the usage of the API and identify potential bad actors. \nA good user agent should include the name of the library or website that is accessing the API along with a URL/e-email where someone can be contacted regarding the library/website. \nFor example: `curl -H \"User-Agent: My Library (https://github.com/username/repo)\" https://icanhazdadjoke.com/`\n## Endpoints\n### Fetch a random dad joke\n`GET https://icanhazdadjoke.com/` fetch a random dad joke. \nFetching a random joke as JSON: \n```\n$ curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" https://icanhazdadjoke.com/\n{\n \"id\": \"R7UfaahVfFd\",\n \"joke\": \"My dog used to chase people on a bike a lot.

patches or pits) on a pair of standard six-sided dice.\n42 is...\n[+ Add a trivia fact for 42](http://numbersapi.com)\n### Random\n  * [random/trivia](http://numbersapi.com#random/trivia)\n  * [random/year](http://numbersapi.com#random/year)\n  * [random/date](http://numbersapi.com#random/date)\n  * [random/math](http://numbersapi.com#random/math)\n\n\n[This page has been shared more times than the number of days in each of the 24 cycles of the Chinese calendar.](http://numbersapi.com#15?notfound=floor&fragment)\n# API Reference\nBring meaning to your metrics and stories to your dates with our API of interesting number facts.\n## URL Structure\nJust hit `http://numbersapi.com/[](http://numbersapi.com/)**number**/**type**`to get a plain text response, where\n  * **`type`**is one of`trivia` , `math`, `date`, or `year`. Defaults to `trivia` if omitted.\n  * **`number`**is\n    * an integer, or\n    * the keyword `random`, for which we will try to return a random available fact, or\n    * a day of year in the form `**month**/**day**`(eg.`2/29` , `1/09`, `04/1`), if **`type`**is`date`\n    * [ranges of numbers](http://numbersapi.com#batching)\n\n```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/42\n⇒ 42 is the result given by Google and Bing for the query \"the answer to life the universe and everything\".\nhttp://numbersapi.com/2/29/date\n⇒ February 29 is the day in 1504 that Christopher Columbus uses his knowledge of a lunar eclipse to convince Native Americans to provide him with supplies.\nhttp://numbersapi.com/random/year\n⇒ 2013 is the year that China will attempt its first unmanned Moon landing.\n\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n### jQuery\nHTML:\n```\nWe now have more users than <span id=\"number\"></span>!\n```\n\nJavaScript:\n```\n$.get('http://numbersapi.com/1337/trivia?notfound=floor&fragment', function(data) {\n  $('#number').text(data);\n});\n```\n\nDirect cross-origin requests like this are possible on browsers that support [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing). Live demo on [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/divad12/ffHEh/).\n### JSONP\n...is supported with the query field [`callback`](http://numbersapi.com#callback):\n```\n<span id=\"number-fact\"></span>\n<script>\n  function showNumber(str) {\n    document.getElementById('number-fact').innerText = str;\n  }\n  (function() {\n    var scriptTag = document.createElement('script');\n    scriptTag.async = true;\n    scriptTag.src = \"http://numbersapi.com/42/math?callback=showNumber\";\n    document.body.appendChild(scriptTag);\n  })();\n</script>\n```\n\nLive demo on [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/divad12/4A6Pw/).\n### HTML Embed\nAdd `write` to your query string to have the response text wrapped in `document.write()`. Now you can stick just a single `<script>` directly where the fact should go.\n```\nDid you know 2012 is the year that <script src=\"http://numbersapi.com/2012/year?write&fragment\"></script>?\n```\n\nNote that this may [degrade page load speed](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom). Live demo on [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/divad12/vd58j/).\n## Query Parameter Options\n### Fragment\nReturn the fact as a sentence fragment that can be easily included as part of a larger sentence. This means that the first word is lowercase and ending punctuation is omitted. For trivia and math, a noun phrase is returned that can be used in a sentence like \"We now have more users than [fact as fragment]!\". ```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/23/trivia?fragment\n⇒ the number of times Julius Caesar was stabbed\nhttp://numbersapi.com/1969/year?fragment\n⇒ an estimated 500 million people worldwide watch Neil Armstrong take his historic first steps on the Moon\n\n```\n\n### Notfound\nThe `notfound` field tells us what to do if the number is not found. You can give us\n  * `default` to return one of our pre-written missing messages, or a message you supply with the [`default`](http://numbersapi.com#default) query field. This is the default behaviour.```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/314159265358979\n⇒ 314159265358979 is a boring number.\n```\n\n  * `floor` to round down to the largest number that does have an associated fact, and return that fact.```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/35353?notfound=floor\n⇒ 35000 is the number of genes in a human being.\n```\n\n  * `ceil`, which is like `floor` but rounds up to the smallest number that has an associated fact.```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/-12344/year?notfound=ceil\n⇒ 98 BC is the year that the Senate passes the Lex Caecilia Didia which bans omnibus bills.\n```\n\n\n\nCombine with the [fragment](http://numbersapi.com#fragment) option to produce interesting facts about, for example, [the number of page shares](http://numbersapi.com#visitors).\n### Default\nThe value of the `default` query field tells us what to return if we don't have a fact for the requested number. ```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/1234567890987654321/year?default=Boring+number+is+boring.\n⇒ Boring number is boring.\n\n```\n\n### Callback\nTo use [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP), pass to the `callback` query the name of the JavaScript function to be invoked. The response will be that function called on the fact text as a string literal. ```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/42/math?callback=showNumber\n⇒ showNumber(\"42 is the 5th Catalan number.\");\n\n```\n\nSee the [JSONP usage example](http://numbersapi.com#jsonp).\n### Write\nReturns the text response wrapped in a call to [`document.write()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/document.write). Note that using this query parameter is equivalent to and just a shorthand of `?callback=document.write`. ```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/42/math?write\n⇒ document.write(\"42 is the 5th Catalan number.\");\n\n```\n\nSee the [HTML embed tag usage example](http://numbersapi.com#single-script-tag).\n### Min and Max\nRestrict the range of values returned to the inclusive range [**`min`**,**`max`**] when`random` is given as the number.\n```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/random?min=10&max=20\n13 is the number of provinces and territories in Canada.\n\n```\n\n### Json\nInclude the query parameter `json` or set the HTTP header `Content-Type` to `application/json` to return the fact and associated meta-data as a JSON object, with the properties: \n  * `text`: A string of the fact text itself.\n  * `found`: Boolean of whether there was a fact for the requested number.\n  * `number`: The floating-point number that the fact pertains to. This may be useful for, eg. a `/random` request or `notfound=floor`. For a date fact, this is the 1-indexed day of a leap year (eg. 61 would be March 1st).\n  * `type`: String of the category of the returned fact.\n  * `date` (sometimes): A day of year associated with some year facts, as a string.\n  * `year` (sometimes): A year associated with some date facts, as a string.\n\n```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/random/year?json\n⇒ {\n  \"text\": \"2012 is the year that the century's second and last solar transit of Venus occurs on June 6.\",\n  \"found\": true,\n  \"number\": 2012,\n  \"type\": \"year\",\n  \"date\": \"June 6\"\n}\n\n```\n\n## Batch Requests\nTo get facts about multiple numbers in one request, specify ranges for `**number**`in`http://numbersapi.com/[](http://numbersapi.com/)**number**/**type**`.\nA number range (inclusive) is specified as `**min**..**max**`. Separate multiple ranges and individual numbers with`,` (a comma).\nThe response format will always be a JSON map from numbers to facts, of at most 100 numbers. The query parameter [`json`](http://numbersapi.com/#json) may still be used to specify whether individual facts will be returned as string literals or JSON objects.\n```\nhttp://numbersapi.com/1..3,10\n⇒ {\n  \"1\": \"1 is the number of dimensions of a line.\",\n  \"2\": \"2 is the number of polynucleotide strands in a DNA double helix.\",\n  \"3\": \"3 is the number of sets needed to be won to win the whole match in volleyball.\",\n  \"10\": \"10 is the highest score possible in Olympics gymnastics competitions.\"\n}\n\n```\n\nHacked up by [David](http://david-hu.com/2012/03/05/announcing-numbers-api.html) and [Mack](http://mduan.com).

This appears to be the core API of the service, allowing developers to programmatically access status code representations.\n\n**Code Snippet**:\n```python\nimport requests\n\nstatus_code = \"404\"\nurl = f\"https://http.dog/{status_code}.json\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    print(f\"Status: {data.get('code')} - {data.get('phrase')}\")\n    print(f\"Image URL: {data.get('image')}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}\")\n```\n\n**API 2: HTTP Response Check API**  \n**API Description**: Based on the \"HTTP Response API\" link in the SEO Toolbox section, this likely provides programmatic access to HTTP response code verification and testing capabilities.\n\n**Code Snippet**:\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl_to_check = \"https://api.http.codes/check\"\nparams = {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}\n\nresponse = requests.get(url_to_check, params=params)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    report = response.json()\n    print(f\"HTTP Status for {params['url']}: {report.get('status_code')}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Check failed with status: {response.status_code}\")\n```\n\n**API 3: Search Engine Bot Verification API**  \n**API Description**: The listed bot-specific APIs (Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.) likely provide verification services to confirm legitimate crawler activity through programmatic endpoints.\n\n**Code Snippet**:\n```python\nimport requests\n\nbot_api_url = \"https://api.seoapi.com/googlebot\"\nheaders = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"}\n\nresponse = requests.get(bot_api_url, headers=headers)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    verification_data = response.json()\n    print(f\"Last crawl date: {verification_data.get('last_crawl')}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Verification failed: {response.status_code}\")\n```"

Your freedoms are: \n  * You may use it in free and non free software.\n  * You may [install](https://gitlab.com/radiobrowser/radiobrowser-api-rust/-/blob/master/README.md?ref_type=heads) it on your own server and mirror all its data.\n  * You may [fork](https://gitlab.com/radiobrowser/radiobrowser-api-rust/-/forks/new) it\n  * You may look at the [stats](https://stats.api.radio-browser.info/)\n  * You may look at the [network structure](http://api.radio-browser.info/net)\n\n\n## HowTo\nThere are 2 possible ways to use this API: \n  * use it directly\n  * use 3rd party libraries\n\n\n### use it directly\nThese steps should be done in your APP or program. \n  1. _Get a list of available servers_\nDo a DNS-lookup of 'all.api.radio-browser.info'. This gives you a list of all available servers. To get the nice names you can do a reverse DNS-Lookup of the entries from the first request and display them to the user. There are some examples of how to do this in different languages: [NodeJS (prefered)](http://api.radio-browser.info/examples/serverlist_fast.js), [NodeJS](http://api.radio-browser.info/examples/serverlist.js), [Python 2](http://api.radio-browser.info/examples/serverlist_python2.py), [Python 3](http://api.radio-browser.info/examples/serverlist_python3.py), [Java (Android)](http://api.radio-browser.info/examples/serverlist.java), [C#](http://api.radio-browser.info/examples/serverlist.cs), [Javascript(Browser)](http://api.radio-browser.info/examples/serverlist-browser.js) Now you have a list of multiple names of servers which you can use to directly connect to with HTTP and preferably HTTPS. Example: https://de2.api.radio-browser.info, https://fi1.api.radio-browser.info, .. _(Alternative: query the DNS SRV record of _api._tcp.radio-browser.info which gives you the list of server names directly without reverse dns lookups.)_\n  2. _Randomize the list_\nEither let the user choose one server from the list with a dialog or just randomize the list and choose the first entry of the now random list. If a request fails just retry the request with the next entry in the list. \n  3. _Remember the following things_\n     * Send a speaking http agent string (e.g. mycoolapp/1.4)\n     * Send /json/url requests for every click the user makes, this helps to mark stations as popular and makes the database more usefull to other people.\n     * Send feature requests/bugs to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/radiobrowser/radiobrowser-api-rust/-/issues)\n  4. _Continue with the docs of the server_\nI try to keep them all at the same version, so they should always all be the same. Here are some examples of working servers: <https://fi1.api.radio-browser.info>, <https://de2.api.radio-browser.info> Click the links to find out about the API. Please remember that any of them may go down in the future, which means that you always should follow the previous steps in your app. \n\n\n### 3rd party libraries\n  * radiobrowser4j Java library - [GitHub](https://github.com/sfuhrm/radiobrowser4j)\n  * NodeJS module - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/radio-browser) - [GitHub](https://github.com/nepodev/radio-browser)\n  * Python module - [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/pyradios/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/andreztz/pyradios)\n  * Rust crate - [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/radiobrowser) - [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/radiobrowser/radiobrowser-lib-rust)\n  * Go library - [goradios](https://gitlab.com/AgentNemo/goradios)\n  * .NET Library - [GitHub](https://github.com/tofudd/RadioBrowser)\n\n\n## Notice\nUsers of the old API (SERVER = www.radio-browser.info) should migrate to the new one. It uses a newer server software, which is actively maintained and which is faster. \n### I am still using the old API, what should I do?\nThere are only a few minor changes in the api. Most things can be kept the same. \n  1. Do NOT use the \"id\" fields anymore! They do not work accross multiple servers. Use the uuid fields instead (e.g.: stationuuid, checkuuid, clickuuid). These fields are kept consistend accross servers in the network. If you still use id fields to for example keep a favourite station list please change this behaviour as soon as posible. \n  2. Do NOT use the \"country\" fields anymore! Use \"countrycode\" instead, which is [standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). \n  3. In the JSON some fields that were previously strings, are now numbers or bools. Please visit the docs for that. \n  4. Never use a direct link to a single new server. It is much better to get a list of the servers like described above. Available server names may change. \n\n\n",

This API is in beta level of development need to work and test more.\n## Features\n  * Filter stopping words from given text/file/link.\n  * Filter stemming words from given text/file/link.\n  * Get swear words from given text/file/link\n\n\n## Stopping and Porter stemming algorithm\nStop words are words that are filtered out before or after processing of natural language data, Though \"stop words\" usually refers to the most common words in a language i.e this, that, what, where...etc \nThe Porter stemming algorithm (or 'Porter stemmer') is a process for removing the commoner morphological and inflexional endings from words in English. Its main use is as part of a term normalization process that is usually done when setting up Information Retrieval systems.\nTerms with a common stem will usually have similar meanings, for example:\n```\nREPORT\nREPROTING\nREPORTS\nREPORTED\n....\nCONNECT\nCONNECTION\nCONNECTED\nCONNECTING\nCONNECTIONs\n\n```\n\nBy removing the various suffixs -ED,-ING,-ION,IONS to leave the single word.\n## How Exude API library works\n  1. Filter the duplicate words from the input data/file.\n  2. Filter the stopping words from step1 filtered data.\n  3.

API v3 has **breaking changes** compared the previous version of the API, so make sure to read this documentation carefully. The previous version of the API (v2) will be in operation until **October 10, 2025**. If necessary, you can still access [its documentation](https://xeno-canto.org/explore/api/previous).\nIn the original version of Xeno-canto, a very simple web service was provided. In 2013, a more full-featured, RESTful JSON-based API was introduced. Over the years, both the search options and the data returned by API v2 were greatly expanded.\nThe downside of a popular API is that its use may negatively affect general web site performance. This forced us to add a rate limiter. Another factor affecting performance was the use of generic simple search terms. These are well-suited for the site's general search option, but an API is best served with precise queries. Finally, unrestricted access to the API also contributed to degraded performance.\nCreating a new v3 of the API allowed us to address these issues and more: \n  * The API only accepts [search tags](https://xeno-canto.org/help/search#advanced) for its queries. Existing and several new tags allow the user to exactly define the query, greatly increasing both general performance and the quality of the search results. Example API queries demonstrating new and previously existing search tags are listed under [Examples](https://xeno-canto.org/explore/api#examples).\n  * The API now requires an API key. Every XC member with a verified email address already has one. You can look up yours on your [account page](https://xeno-canto.org/account). If you intend to use the API but don't have an account yet, you will need to register first to use API v3.\n  * The default number of results per page has been reduced from 500 to 100. You can use the new parameter `per_page` to adjust this from 50 to 500 results per page.\n  * We have addressed a few inconsistencies between search tags and properties of the recording object in the search results. Make sure to read the [Changes](https://xeno-canto.org/explore/api#changes) section if you are upgrading from API v2.\n  * As we trust these measures to improve performance of the API and the web site in general, we have lifted the strict rate limit on the API.\n\n\n# Request\nThe endpoint for the webservice is at <https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings>.\n## Query Parameters\nThere are four possible query parameters for this API.\nThe query parameter is _required_ and must be non-empty. The query parameter must be a search string in the format described on the [search tips](https://xeno-canto.org/help/search) page.\nThe key parameter is new to API v3 and is _required_ and must be non-empty as well. A key is available to all [registered XC members](https://xeno-canto.org/account) who have verified their email address. Do not share your key with others and take care not to publish it in any git repositories, as prolonged abuse of the API may result in a warning and ultimately in revocation of your key. If you have accidentally shared your key, please contact the admins for a new one.\nDevelopers building applications on the XC API are encouraged to create a key for their app rather than to use a personal key.\nThe per_page parameter is _optional_ , determining the number of results per page. Valid values for this parameter range between 50 and 500, with a default of 100 when not provided.\nThe page parameter is _optional_ as well and is only needed if the results from a given search don't fit in a single page. If specified, page must be an integer between 1 and results.numPages (see results format below for details).\n# Response\nThe response is returned with a payload in [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. The details are shown below.\n## Success\nFor a successful query, a HTTP 200 response code will be returned, with a payload in the following format:\n```\n       \n      {\n        \"numRecordings\": \"1\",\n        \"numSpecies\": \"1\",\n        \"page\": 1,\n        \"numPages\": 1,\n        \"recordings\": [\n          ...,\n          Array of Recording objects (see below),\n          ...\n        ]\n      }\n      \n      \n```\n\nThis JSON object will contain details about the recordings found with the given query. For performance reasons, the number of recordings returned for a given query will be limited. If the limit is lower than the total number of results, they will be split into 'pages'. To fetch the next page of results, you must append the page query parameter as specified above.\nA brief description of the fields:\n  * numRecording: the total number of recordings found for this query\n  * numSpecies: the total number of species found for this query\n  * page: the page number of the results page that is being displayed\n  * numPages: the total number of pages available for this query\n  * recordings: an array of recording objects, described in detail below\n\n\n## Recording Object\nEach object in the recordings array mentioned above has the following format:\n```\n      \n      {\n        \"id\": \"694038\",\n        \"gen\": \"Troglodytes\",\n        \"sp\": \"troglodytes\",\n        \"ssp\": \"\",\n        \"grp\": \"birds\",\n        \"en\": \"Eurasian Wren\",\n        \"rec\": \"Jacobo Ramil MIllarengo\",\n        \"cnt\": \"Spain\",\n        \"loc\": \"Sisalde, Ames, A Coru\\u00f1a, Galicia\",\n        \"lat\": \"42.8373\",\n        \"lon\": \"-8.652\",\n        \"alt\": \"30\",\n        \"type\": \"song\",\n        \"sex\": \"male\",\n        \"stage\": \"adult\",\n        \"method\": \"field recording\",\n        \"url\": \"\\/\\/xeno-canto.org\\/694038\",\n        \"file\": \"\\/\\/xeno-canto.org\\/694038\\/download\",\n        \"file-name\": \"XC694038-211223_02Carrizo variaci\\u00f3ns dunha frase bastante stereotipada siteD 9.30 Sisalde.mp3\",\n        \"sono\": {\n          \"small\": \"\\/\\/xeno-canto.org\\/sounds\\/uploaded\\/LHCOINSOBZ\\/ffts\\/XC694038-small.png\",\n          \"med\": \"\\/\\/xeno-canto.org\\/sounds\\/uploaded\\/LHCOINSOBZ\\/ffts\\/XC694038-med.png\",\n          \"large\": \"\\/\\/xeno-canto.org\\/sounds\\/uploaded\\/LHCOINSOBZ\\/ffts\\/XC694038-large.png\",\n          \"full\": \"\\/\\/xeno-canto.org\\/sounds\\/uploaded\\/LHCOINSOBZ\\/ffts\\/XC694038-full.png\"\n        },\n        \"osci\": {\n          \"small\": \"\\/\\/xeno-canto.org\\/sounds\\/uploaded\\/LHCOINSOBZ\\/wave\\/XC694038-small.png\",\n          \"med\": \"\\/\\/xeno-canto.org\\/sounds\\/uploaded\\/LHCOINSOBZ\\/wave\\/XC694038-med.png\",\n          \"large\": \"\\/\\/xeno-canto.org\\/sounds\\/uploaded\\/LHCOINSOBZ\\/wave\\/XC694038-large.png\"\n        },\n        \"lic\": \"\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/4.0\\/\",\n        \"q\": \"A\",\n        \"length\": \"4:08\",\n        \"time\": \"09:30\",\n        \"date\": \"2021-12-23\",\n        \"uploaded\": \"2021-12-27\",\n        \"also\": [\n          \"Turdus viscivorus\",\n          \"Turdus iliacus\",\n          \"Parus major\"\n        ],\n        \"rmk\": \"A male repeat a stereotyped phrase with few syllabic variation.

It's a good idea to [familiarize yourself](https://xeno-canto.org/help/search#advanced) with the options these tags provide, as their use isn't exactly straightforward!\nBefore diving into the examples, we need to reiterate that searching for species without tags (as was the default for API v2) is now **discontinued**. Another important fact to bare in mind is that you **must quote search tags** consisting of multiple terms, or terms using operators (=, < or >). Again, see [Search tips](https://xeno-canto.org/help/search#advanced) for more information. Finally, in API v3 you will need to append your key to every API call. Off to a rough start, as these three examples fail: \n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=larus fuscus&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=larus fuscus&key=demo) (API v2 style query without tags -> **throws an error**)\n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=sp:larus fuscus&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=sp:larus fuscus&key=demo) (unquoted, resolving into a 'tag-less' query for fuscus -> **throws an error**)\n  * <https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=sp:\"larus fuscus\"> (correctly quoted, but no key provided -> **throws an error**)\n\n\n## Taxonomic examples\n### sp, gen\nLikely the most often used API call is to fetch recordings for a specific species. While in API v2 this was done by just providing the species name without tags, in v3 this requires the sp tag (for species) or combination of gen (for genus) and sp tags. The sp tag can be used for a complete species name (remember: between quotes); in combination with a gen tag (resulting in essentially the same query); or for just the specific epithet.\nMoving on to working examples, both \n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=sp:\"larus fuscus\"&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=sp:\"larus fuscus\"&key=demo)\n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=gen:larus+sp:fuscus&per_page=50&page=3&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=gen:larus+sp:fuscus&per_page=50&page=3&key=demo)\n\nwill fetch all recordings for just the Lesser Black-backed Gull _Larus fuscus_ (the second also demonstrating the use of the pagination parameters), while \n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=sp:fuscus&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=sp:fuscus&key=demo)\n\nwill also feature results for (among others) the South American White-lipped Grassfrog _Leptodactylus fuscus_ and the Big Brown Bat _Eptesicus fuscus_. Needless to say, the gen tag can also be used independently to fetch all recordings for a specific genus. \n### grp\nIf you want to narrow down the previous example to just birds, you can add the grp tag. Thus \n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=sp:fuscus+grp:birds&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=sp:fuscus+grp:birds&key=demo)\n\nwill search for all birds having the specific epithet _fuscus_. See the [Search tips](https://xeno-canto.org/help/search) for all possible grp options. \n### ssp\nA search for _Larus fuscus_ may still be to broad if you are only interested in recordings of the nominate Baltic Gull _Larus fuscus fuscus_. In that case, append the ssp tag to your query, or use a triplet similar to the pair of the sp tag: \n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=gen:larus+sp:fuscus+ssp:fuscus&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=gen:larus+sp:fuscus+ssp:fuscus&key=demo)\n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=ssp:\"larus fuscus fuscus\"&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=ssp:\"larus fuscus fuscus\"&key=demo)\n\n\n### fam\nConversely, if you want to broaden your search to all gulls, not just those from the genus _Larus_ , this is now availabe with the new fam tag: \n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=fam:laridae&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=fam:laridae&key=demo)\n\n\n### en\nFinally, it is also possible to search for taxa using their vernacular name in English using the en tag. There are good reasons to avoid this type of search though. First, unlike scientific names, common names are not guaranteed to be unique. Second, this search option tends to be slow, as it involves a wildcard search by default. Compare the performance of two queries on 'lesser black-backed gull', one using the default wildcard search, the other including the matches operator: \n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=en:\"lesser black-backed gull\"&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=en:\"lesser black-backed gull\"&key=demo) (wildcard search, slow)\n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=en:\"=lesser black-backed gull\"&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=en:\"=lesser black-backed gull\"&key=demo) (matches search)\n\nAn extreme example is this query, which (as of writing) potentially returns results from twelve different species sharing the vernacular name 'Bladder Grasshopper': \n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=en:=\"=bladder grasshopper\"&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=en:\"=bladder grasshopper\"&key=demo)\n\n\n## Geographic examples\n### area, cnt, location\nThere are several ways to geographically limit your queries. In order of scale, they are area (world area, more or less at continental level), cnt (country) and loc (location). The examples cover land mammals from Asia, frogs from Surinam and birds from Suffolk Coastal District, Suffolk, England. \n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=area:asia+grp:\"land mammals\"&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=area:asia+grp:\"land mammals\"&key=demo)\n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=cnt:surinam+grp:frogs&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=cnt:surinam+grp:frogs&key=demo)\n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=loc:\"Suffolk Coastal District, Suffolk, England\"+grp:birds&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=loc:\"Suffolk Coastal District, Suffolk, England\"+grp:birds&key=demo)\n\n\n### lat, lon, box\nAlternatively, you can base your query on lat (latitude), lon (longitude), or a combination thereof. The examples return birds recorded above the Arctic Circle (65° N), bats recorded around 4.2884N, 36.2626E (in Kenya) and grasshoppers recorded in a bounding box covering parts of Sumatra, Malaysia and Singapore:\n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=grp:birds lat:\">66.5\"&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=grp:birds lat:\">66.5\"&key=demo)\n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=lat:4.2884+lon:36.2626+grp:bats&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=lat:4.2884+lon:36.2626+grp:bats&key=demo)\n  * [https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=box:-1.16,94.62,6.34,106.48+grp:grasshoppers&key=demo](https://xeno-canto.org/api/3/recordings?query=box:-1.16,94.62,6.34,106.48+grp:grasshoppers&key=demo)\n\n\n## Date-related examples\n### year, month, since\nThe year and month tags allow filtering on recording dates before, after or between specific periods. The since tag can be used to search for date of uploading.

List & API\n[](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list#university-domains-and-names-data-list--api)\nDo you need a list of universities and their domain names? You found it!\nThis package includes a JSON file that contains domains, names and countries of most of the universities of the world.\nExample usecases:\n  * You can create a validation script that checks the email domain.\n  * You can automatically generate a user's country and university by looking at their emails.\n\n\nYou can use this data source in three ways:\n  * Use the JSON file as your data source and do whatever you like with your favourite programming language.\n  * Use free hosted-API.\n  * Use the tiny Python app to serve a fast API that you can query data.\n\n\n### 1 - Using the Data Source\n[](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list#1---using-the-data-source)\nThe whole data source is located in the `world_universities_and_domains.json` file. It is just a list of dictionaries in the following format:\n```\n[\n\t...\n\t{\n\t  \"alpha_two_code\": \"TR\",\n\t  \"country\": \"Turkey\",\n\t  \"state-province\": null,\n\t  \"domains\": [\n\t    \"sabanciuniv.edu\",\n\t    \"sabanciuniv.edu.tr\"\n\t  ],\n\t  \"name\": \"Sabanci University\",\n\t  \"web_pages\": [\n\t    \"http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/\",\n\t    \"http://www.sabanciuniv.edu.tr/\"\n\t  ],\n\t},\n\t...\n]\n\n```\n\nIf you want a smaller final payload and only need a subset of countries, run\n```\nfilter.py $country1 [Optional: $country2]\n```\n\nfrom the root directory to return\n```\nfiltered_world_universities_and_domains.json\n\n```\n\nNOTE: Some universities use a format like `[user]@[department].[domain]`, but this list only contains the `[domain]` portion. For example, an email address might be `[student]@cs.usc.edu`, and this list will contain 'usc.edu', the domain for the University of Southern California. Take this into consideration if using this list for email address validation.\n### 2 - Using The Hosted API\n[](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list#2---using-the-hosted-api)\nThis is the easiest method if you're making a small project or just want to discover the data without any hassle. It is sponsored by [Hipo](http://www.hipolabs.com) and free. If you have a big project, please host it on your own server.\nSome example searches:\n  * <http://universities.hipolabs.com>\n  * <http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle>\n  * [http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle&country=turkey](http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle&country=turkey)\n\n\nThe hosted API uses [university-domains-list-api](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api) package.\n### 3 - Using the built-in API on your server\n[](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list#3---using-the-built-in-api-on-your-server)\nYou can access the python API via [university-domains-list-api](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api)\n# Contribution\n[](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list#contribution)\nPlease contribute to this list! We need your support to keep this list up-to-date. Do not hesitate to fix any wrong data. It is extremely easy. Just open a PR, or create an issue.\n# Contributors\n[](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list#contributors)\n  * Yiğit Güler\n  * Tuna Vargı\n  * Patrick Michelberger\n  * Rasim Demirbay\n  * Ryan White\n  * Bilal Arslan\n  * anwilli5\n  * Thomas Bauer\n  * Emin Mastizada\n  * Jai\n  * Jimi Ford\n  * Lars Schwegmann\n  * Sedat Karancı\n  * Charles Bedrosian\n  * Harrison Lo\n  * mattdfloyd\n  * Ender Ahmet Yurt\n  * Enis Behiç Tuysuz\n  * Syed Zakawat\n  * Daksh Shah\n  * Maizer Gomes\n  * Denys Vitali\n  * Ary Wibowo\n  * Matt Floyd\n  * Joris Boquet\n  * Konstantin Ladutenko\n  * Romain Odeval\n  * remediate\n  * Errorific\n  * summerplaybook\n  * hamedty\n  * Sedat\n  * Sotirios Roussis\n  * majilesh\n  * Itay Grudev\n  * luungoc2005\n  * Ajithkumar Sekar\n  * Christopher Chen\n  * Dimitris Karakostas\n  * Chun Fei Lung\n  * Mamat Rahmat\n  * Wisnu Adi Nurcahyo\n  * jvanstraten\n  * Ekin Dursun\n  * Kevin Bohinski\n  * Lachlan Marnham\n  * Baptiste Pellarin\n  * Kelian Baert\n  * [more](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/graphs/contributors)\n\n\n### Created and maintained by [Hipo](http://www.hipolabs.com)\n[](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list#created-and-maintained-by-hipo)\n## About\nUniversity Domains and Names Data List & API \n### Resources\n[ Readme ](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list#readme-ov-file)\n### License\n[ MIT license ](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list#MIT-1-ov-file)\n[ Activity](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/activity)\n[ Custom properties](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/custom-properties)\n### Stars\n[ **1.4k** stars](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/stargazers)\n### Watchers\n[ **28** watching](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/watchers)\n### Forks\n[ **473** forks](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/forks)\n[ Report repository ](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FHipo%2Funiversity-domains-list&report=Hipo+%28user%29)\n##  [Releases](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/releases)\nNo releases published\n##  [Packages 0](https://github.com/orgs/Hipo/packages?repo_name=university-domains-list)\nNo packages published \n##  [Contributors 247](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/graphs/contributors)\n[+ 233 contributors](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/graphs/contributors)\n## Languages\n  * [ Python 100.0% ](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/search?l=python)\n\n\n## Footer\n[ ](https://github.com \"GitHub\") © 2025 GitHub, Inc. \n### Footer navigation\n  * [Terms](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)\n  * [Privacy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)\n  * [Security](https://github.com/security)\n  * [Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)\n  * [Docs](https://docs.github.com/)\n  * [Contact](https://support.github.com?tags=dotcom-footer)\n  * Manage cookies \n  * Do not share my personal information \n\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time. \n",

Send a GET request to newton with a url-encoded math expression and your preferred operation.\n  2. Get back a JSON response with your problem solved.\n\n\n### Show me\n[](https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api#show-me)\nLet's find the derivative of x^2. So, we send a request to the newton url saying just that:\n-> `https://newton.now.sh/api/v2/derive/x%5E2` (Note the url-encoded `^`)\nNow, we get the following response:\n```\n{\n \"operation\":\"derive\",\n \"expression\":\"x^2\",\n \"result\":\"2 x\"\n}\n\n```\n\nIt's that simple!\n### Get Started\n[](https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api#get-started)\n  1. Send a GET request to newton.\n\n\n```\nhttps://newton.now.sh/api/v2/:operation/:expression\n\n```\n\nNote: `:operation` is the math operation that you want to perform. `:expression` is the _url-encoded_ math expression on which you want to operate. **View available operation endpoints below!**\n  1. That's it! You'll be returned a JSON object with the operation you requested, the expression you provided, and the result of the operation performed on the expression.\n\n\n### View available endpoints:\n[](https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api#view-available-endpoints)\nOperation | API Endpoint | Result  \n---|---|---  \nSimplify | /simplify/2^2+2(2) | 8  \nFactor | /factor/x^2 + 2x | x (x + 2)  \nDerive | /derive/x^2+2x | 2 x + 2  \nIntegrate | /integrate/x^2+2x | 1/3 x^3 + x^2 + C  \nFind 0's | /zeroes/x^2+2x | [-2, 0]  \nFind Tangent | /tangent/2lx^3 | 12 x + -16  \nArea Under Curve | /area/2:4lx^3 | 60  \nCosine | /cos/pi | -1  \nSine | /sin/0 | 0  \nTangent | /tan/0 | 0  \nInverse Cosine | /arccos/1 | 0  \nInverse Sine | /arcsin/0 | 0  \nInverse Tangent | /arctan/0 | 0  \nAbsolute Value | /abs/-1 | 1  \nLogarithm | /log/2l8 | 3  \n_Keep in mind:_ To find the tangent line of a function at a certain x value, send the request as c|f(x) where c is the given x value and f(x) is the function expression, the separator is a vertical bar '|'. See the table above for an example request.\nTo find the area under a function, send the request as c:d|f(x) where c is the starting x value, d is the ending x value, and f(x) is the function under which you want the curve between the two x values.\nTo compute fractions, enter expressions as numerator(over)denominator. For example, to process 2/4 you must send in your expression as 2(over)4.

However, for high-volume queries, it’s more efficient to query the European Central Bank data directly from your server than using our API.  \n\nWill the API work in the future?\n     We've been running for over a decade and have no plans to shut down. For critical applications, we recommend self-hosting for greater control.  \n\nWhat is the privacy policy of the API?\n     The API itself does not collect personal data. However, the public app runs behind Cloudflare for performance, and Cloudflare will collect some basic information for analytics. This does not apply if you run the API privately.  \n\nWhat should I do if a currency is missing?\n     If you notice a currency missing from our data, please [open an issue](https://github.com/lineofflight/frankfurter/issues) and include a suggested source with the missing data. We're looking for non-commercial sources that publish current and historical daily rates at the end of each working day.

Check out our [Imgflip Slack App](https://api.imgflip.com/slack).\nThe Imgflip API uses a RESTful JSON interface. Request parameters are standard HTTP form urlencoded parameters, and return data is JSON. \nThe base version of the API is free. You can upgrade to our Premium API to unlock advanced features. Requests to the free version of the API do not have a hard limit, but may be throttled or blocked if you start doing crazy things or abusing the API. The Premium API has a base cost of $9.99 per month and includes some Premium requests each month (details below). After that, each type of Premium request has a small per-request cost. Note that the free API endpoints are still free if you have API Premium, you'll only be charged for the Premium-only features. \nFeel free to contact us at general@imgflip.com with any questions or suggestions. \nFree | Premium  \n---|---  \nGet top memes | Yes | Yes  \nMake memes for free | Yes | Yes  \nCaption animated GIFs | No | **Yes**  \nSearch all 1M+ memes | No | **Yes**  \nMake memes without watermark | No | **Yes**  \nMake memes with AI (automeme and ai_meme) | No | **Yes**  \nGet Premium  \n/get_memes\nGets an array of popular user-uploaded memes that may be captioned with this API. The size of this array and the order of memes may change at any time. When this description was written, it returned 100 memes ordered by how many times they were captioned in the last 30 days. Additional properties other than those listed below may be added in the future without warning, so do not assume the JSON structure of each meme will never have new properties. \nURL: https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes\nMethod: GET\nExample Success Response:\nbox_count is the default number of boxes each meme uses. some memes have many text boxes\n```\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"data\": {\n   \"memes\": [\n     {\n      \"id\": \"61579\",\n      \"name\": \"One Does Not Simply\",\n      \"url\": \"https://i.imgflip.com/1bij.jpg\",\n      \"width\": 568,\n      \"height\": 335,\n      \"box_count\": 2\n     },\n     {\n      \"id\": \"101470\",\n      \"name\": \"Ancient Aliens\",\n      \"url\": \"https://i.imgflip.com/26am.jpg\",\n      \"width\": 500,\n      \"height\": 437,\n      \"box_count\": 2\n     }\n     // probably a lot more memes here..\n   ]\n  }\n}\n\t\t\n```\n\n/caption_image\nAdd a caption to an Imgflip meme template. Images created with this API will be publicly accessible by anyone through the url in the response - there is no \"private\" option. This does not mean these memes will be posted publicly though, one still needs to know the exact URL to find the image. If the image hangs around on Imgflip servers for a while and gets very few views (direct image views and image page views both count), it will be auto-deleted to save space. \nFor a real working example of the API, check out this [hubot script](https://github.com/dylanwenzlau/hubot-scripts/commit/6db48d050f32739dd4ba90b49df2ee8fbefecdb6) (written in coffeescript). That script is open source, so feel free to use that set of regexes as a starting place. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you plan to use the API for anything other than testing, you should create your own Imgflip account and use that instead of the default imgflip_hubot account, because that account may be limited as soon as you send a non-trivial number of requests, and then your script wouldn't be able to make memes anymore, and everyone would be sad. \nURL: https://api.imgflip.com/caption_image\nMethod: POST\nInput Parameters\nAll memes on Imgflip can have custom default font settings which will be used if you do not specify the exact settings you want. For example, this allows a meme such as [Two Buttons](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/Two-Buttons) to default to uncapitalized black text with rotation applied, because it fits the template better. \nkey | value  \n---|---  \ntemplate_id |  A template ID as returned by the get_memes response. Any ID that was ever returned from the get_memes response should work for this parameter. For custom template uploads, the template ID can be found in the memegenerator URL, e.g. https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/14859329/Charlie-Sheen-DERP. Also, here is a list of the [top 100 Imgflip meme IDs](https://api.imgflip.com/popular-meme-ids).   \nusername |  username of a valid imgflip account. This is used to track where API requests are coming from.   \npassword | password for the imgflip account. As always, make sure password (and all the other parameters) are in the _body_ of the POST request, _not_ in the request url.  \ntext0 | Top text for the meme (do not use this parameter if you are using the boxes parameter below)  \ntext1 | Bottom text for the meme (do not use this parameter if you are using the boxes parameter below)  \nfont |  [optional] The font family to use for the text. Defaults to impact. You can also use \"arial\" or any of the 1,500+ Google Fonts which you can see in the font menu at [imgflip.com/memegenerator](https://api.imgflip.com/memegenerator).   \nmax_font_size |  [optional] Maximum font size in pixels. Defaults to 50px.   \nno_watermark | Get Premium[optional] [premium only] Remove the imgflip.com watermark. First 100 per month included, then $0.01 per creation.  \nboxes |  [optional] For creating memes with more than two text boxes, or for further customization. If boxes is specified, text0 and text1 will be ignored, and text will not be automatically converted to uppercase, so you'll have to handle capitalization yourself if you want the standard uppercase meme text. The API is currently limited to 20 text boxes per image. All options below are optional, except \"text\". The exception is that you may leave the first box completely empty, so that the second box will automatically be used for the bottom text.  x, y, width, and height are for the bounding box of the text box. x and y are the coordinates of the top left corner. If you specify bounding coordinates, be sure to specify all four (x, y, width, height), otherwise your text may not show up correctly. If you do not specify bounding box coordinates, the same automatic default coordinates from imgflip.com/memegenerator will be used, which is very useful for memes with special text box positioning other than the simple top/bottom.  Example \"boxes\" array: ```\n[\n  {\n   \"text\": \"One does not simply\",\n   \"x\": 10,\n   \"y\": 10,\n   \"width\": 548,\n   \"height\": 100,\n   \"color\": \"#ffffff\",\n   \"outline_color\": \"#000000\"\n  },\n  {\n   \"text\": \"Make custom memes on the web via imgflip API\",\n   \"x\": 10,\n   \"y\": 225,\n   \"width\": 548,\n   \"height\": 100,\n   \"color\": \"#ffffff\",\n   \"outline_color\": \"#000000\"\n  }\n]\n\t\t\t\t\t\n```\n  \nExample Success Response:\n```\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"data\": {\n   \"url\": \"https://i.imgflip.com/123abc.jpg\",\n   \"page_url\": \"https://imgflip.com/i/123abc\"\n  }\n}\n\t\t\n```\n\nExample Failure Response:\n```\n{\n  \"success\" => false,\n  \"error_message\" => \"Some hopefully-useful statement about why it failed\"\n}\n\t\t\n```\n\n/caption_gif Get Premium\nAdd a caption to an Imgflip animated GIF template. Mostly identical to /caption_image above, except the older text0/text1 format is not supported (use boxes instead). \n/caption_gif requires API Premium. First 50 creations per month are included, then $0.02 per creation. \nURL: https://api.imgflip.com/caption_gif\nMethod: POST\nInput Parameters\nkey | value  \n---|---  \ntemplate_id |  An animated template ID.   \nusername | see /caption_image  \npassword  \nfont  \nmax_font_size  \nno_watermark  \nboxes  \n/search_memes Get Premium\nSearch for meme templates that can be captioned with the /caption_image endpoint. This allows you to give users a search input to find which of the 1M+ templates from the Imgflip database they want to use. If you plan to use search-as-you-type and send multiple searches per user, you may want to use caching on your frontend. Do not cache the results globally for all users on your backend though, as memes are constantly updated. \nIMPORTANT NOTE: The Imgflip database is user-generated content, NOT curated content. We have some basic mechanisms to help prevent spam/inappropriate/unauthorized content, but you may want to filter based on your own criteria such as language or number of captions (aka popularity). \nSearching memes requires API Premium. First 200 searches per month are included, then $0.005 per search. \nURL: https://api.imgflip.com/search_memes\nMethod: POST\nInput Parameters\nkey | value  \n---|---  \nusername |  username of the imgflip account with the Premium API subscription   \npassword | password for the imgflip account. As always, make sure password (and all the other parameters) are in the _body_ of the POST request, _not_ in the request url.  \nquery | A text query to search the meme database for. Searches both names and alternate names.  \ninclude_nsfw | [optional] Use include_nsfw=1 to allow not-safe-for-work memes to be returned. Defaults to 0. NSFW memes may contain adult language, comedy, or minimal clothing, but should not contain porn or other content forbidden in the [Imgflip Terms](https://api.imgflip.com/terms).  \nExample Success Response:\nbox_count is the default number of boxes each meme uses. some memes have many text boxes\n```\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"data\": {\n   \"memes\": [\n   {\n     \"id\": \"61579\",\n     \"name\": \"One Does Not Simply\",\n     \"url\": \"https://i.imgflip.com/1bij.jpg\",\n     \"width\": 568,\n     \"height\": 335,\n     \"box_count\": 2,\n     \"captions\": 1750 // estimated number of all-time captions of this meme, rounded\n   },\n   // probably a lot more memes here..\n  ]\n  }\n}\n\t\t\n```\n\n/get_meme Get Premium\nGet a meme by ID. Same return format as /search_memes. Helpful if your users want to upload templates to Imgflip and then give you the ID directly to use in your app/website/bot. Currently Premium only. \nURL: https://api.imgflip.com/get_meme\nMethod: POST\nInput Parameters\nkey | value  \n---|---  \nusername  \npassword  \ntemplate_id  \nExample Success Response:\n```\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"data\": {\n   \"meme\": {\n    \"id\": \"61579\",\n    \"name\": \"One Does Not Simply\",\n    \"url\": \"https://i.imgflip.com/1bij.jpg\",\n    \"width\": 568,\n    \"height\": 335,\n    \"box_count\": 2,\n    \"captions\": 1750 // estimated number of all-time captions of this meme, rounded\n   }\n  }\n}\n\t\t\n```\n\n/automeme Get Premium\nAutomatically caption one of the top 2,048 memes based only on the input text. This allows someone to simply type the phrase they want turned into a meme, and Imgflip magically picks the correct meme and adds their text. Automeme uses a deep neural network trained on millions of public Imgflip memes. Keep in mind that some memes work much better than others for this style of creation, namely shorter simpler memes. Memes with many text locations and no discernible patterns are less likely to work well. \nTo see how it works, try it yourself at [imgflip.com/automeme](https://api.imgflip.com/automeme). This is also what powers the [Imgflip Slack App](https://api.imgflip.com/slack) where you can type phrases like \"/imgflip nobody got time for reading long API docs\". \nAutomeme requires API Premium. First 50 creations per month are included, then $0.02 per creation. \nURL: https://api.imgflip.com/automeme\nMethod: POST\nInput Parameters\nkey | value  \n---|---  \nusername |  username of the imgflip account with the Premium API subscription   \npassword | password for the imgflip account. As always, make sure password (and all the other parameters) are in the _body_ of the POST request, _not_ in the request url.  \ntext | The text to display on the meme. This will also be used to determine which meme template to use.  \nno_watermark | [optional] Remove the imgflip.com watermark.  \nExample Success/Failure:\nSame as /caption_image\n/ai_meme Get Premium\nGenerates a fresh meme from scratch using either OpenAI GPT or Imgflip's own deep neural network trained on millions of public memes. \nIMPORTANT NOTE (only if using classic model): The classic Imgflip AI is trained on all public user-generated content, so it is NOT censored or curated in any way, and therefore may contain vulgarities or other potentially unsuitable content. If this doesn't fit your use case, you may want to filter the output based on language. \nTo see how it works, try it yourself at [imgflip.com/ai-meme](https://api.imgflip.com/ai-meme). \nAI Meme requires API Premium. First 50 creations per month are included, then $0.02 per creation. \nURL: https://api.imgflip.com/ai_meme\nMethod: POST\nInput Parameters\nkey | value  \n---|---  \nusername |  username of the imgflip account with the Premium API subscription   \npassword | password for the imgflip account. As always, make sure password (and all the other parameters) are in the _body_ of the POST request, _not_ in the request url.  \nmodel |  [optional] Which neural network model to use, can be either \"openai\" or \"classic\". Corresponds to the OpenAI GPT and Imgflip Classic Model available on [imgflip.com/ai-meme](https://api.imgflip.com/ai-meme). The current default is \"openai\" if left unspecified.   \ntemplate_id |  [optional] This allows you to choose one of the 48 templates from [imgflip.com/ai-meme](https://api.imgflip.com/ai-meme) if using the classic model, otherwise _any_ popular Imgflip template if using the openai model. If not specified, it will randomly select one of those 48 memes (or top 94 memes for openai). You can find the top 100 template IDs here: [imgflip.com/popular-meme-ids](https://api.imgflip.com/popular-meme-ids), or any other template ID from the template detail page when searching [meme templates](https://api.imgflip.com/memetemplates).   \nprefix_text |  [optional] Max 64 chars. Initial prefix text to seed the meme text, e.g. \"Eric\" to make the meme about Eric. For the openai model, it's used as a general topic rather than strictly prefix text. For the classic model, shorter is generally better as it gives the AI more room for creative variety.   \nno_watermark | [optional] Remove the imgflip.com watermark.  \nExample Success Response:\n```\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"data\": {\n   \"url\": \"https://i.imgflip.com/123abc.jpg\",\n   \"page_url\": \"https://imgflip.com/i/123abc\",\n   \"template_id\": 89370399,\n   \"texts\": [\"you can't get caught to sing a conversation\", \"if you don't have any money\"]\n  }\n}\n\t\t\n```\n\nFree | **Premium**  \n---|---  \nGet top memes | Yes | Yes  \nMake memes for free | Yes | Yes  \nSearch all 1M+ memes | No | **Yes**  \nMake memes without watermark | No | **Yes**  \nMake memes with AI (automeme and ai_meme) | No | **Yes**  \n$9.99 / month $99 / year\nBill Yearly (2 months free)\nPay with Card\n[Imgflip Pro](https://api.imgflip.com/pro?from=footer) [GIF Maker](https://api.imgflip.com/gif-maker) [Meme Generator](https://api.imgflip.com/memegenerator) [Blank Meme Templates](https://api.imgflip.com/memetemplates) [GIF Templates](https://api.imgflip.com/gif-templates) [Chart Maker](https://api.imgflip.com/chart-maker) [Demotivational Maker](https://api.imgflip.com/demotivational-maker) [Image Resizer](https://api.imgflip.com/image-resizer) [About](https://api.imgflip.com/about) [Privacy](https://api.imgflip.com/privacy) [Terms](https://api.imgflip.com/terms) [API](https://api.imgflip.com/api) [Slack App](https://api.imgflip.com/slack) [Request Image Removal](https://api.imgflip.com/request_removal)\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/imgflip) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/imgflip) [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imgflip.twa) [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imgflip-quick-create/ipdbhnffahpohpdkcelabahpmlheidff)\nEmpowering creativity on teh interwebz Imgflip LLC 2025 [Are you a web developer?](https://api.imgflip.com/careers)\n",
