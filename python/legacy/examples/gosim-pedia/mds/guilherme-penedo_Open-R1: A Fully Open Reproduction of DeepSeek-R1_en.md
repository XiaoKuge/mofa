# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning!*  

We’re about to dive into the fascinating world of open AI replication—and who better to guide us than someone who’s gone from designing flying machines to training language models? Please join me in welcoming **Guilherme Penedo**, Machine Learning Research Engineer at Hugging Face and the brains behind projects like FineWeb and Open-R1.  

With a background in aerospace engineering (yes, he once calculated trajectories—now he calculates token distributions), Guilherme has become a key force in democratizing AI. He co-authored the groundbreaking *Falcon Series* paper and leads Hugging Face’s ambitious Open-R1 initiative—because why settle for a black box when you can rebuild it, better and fully open?  

Today’s session, *‘Open-R1: A Fully Open Reproduction of DeepSeek-R1,’* will pull back the curtain on replicating cutting-edge reasoning models. Expect insider insights on data curation, hard-won lessons, and why openness is the future of AI. Spoiler: It involves *a lot* of tokens.  

So, grab your questions—this is your chance to learn from an expert who’s turning AI’s ‘how did they do that?’ into ‘here’s how *we* do it.’ Let’s give a warm welcome to Guilherme Penedo!"*  

*(Pause for applause, transition smoothly.)*

## Event and Session Details

### Conference Overview  
- **Conference Name**: GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates**: May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location**: Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme**: Driving global open-source AI collaboration across six tracks: AI Model, AI Infra, AI Apps, Embodied AI, AI for Science, and Global Open-Source AI Collaboration.  

### Session Details  
- **Title**: Open-R1: A Fully Open Reproduction of DeepSeek-R1  
- **Date**: May 6, 2025  
- **Time**: 10:30 - 11:10  
- **Content**:  
  The recipe behind OpenAI’s reasoning models has been a well kept secret. That is, until earlier this year, when DeepSeek released their DeepSeek-R1 model and promptly broke the internet. While a detailed technical report was published, many open questions remain, chief among them the training data, which was not released. Open-R1 is Hugging Face's fully open effort to replicate DeepSeek-R1, with a strong focus on reasoning data curation.
