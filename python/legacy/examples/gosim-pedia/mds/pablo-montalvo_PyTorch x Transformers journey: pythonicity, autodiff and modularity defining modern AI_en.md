# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:**  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, let‚Äôs give a warm welcome to our next speaker‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs made documents far more interesting than any of us ever thought possible. Please join me in welcoming Pablo Montalvo, Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face and a key player in the world of document AI and OCR technologies.  

With a PhD in Physics and a career that‚Äôs taken him from Rakuten to Hugging Face, Pablo has been instrumental in releasing massive open-source OCR datasets‚Äîwe‚Äôre talking billions of text tokens here‚Äîproving that yes, even paperwork can be groundbreaking. His work has contributed to Hugging Face being named one of TIME‚Äôs 100 Most Influential Companies, and if you‚Äôve ever used a transformer model, chances are you‚Äôve benefited from his contributions.  

Today, Pablo will take us on a journey through the evolution of PyTorch and Transformers, exploring how Pythonic design, autodiff, and modularity have shaped modern AI. Expect insights on how clarity and pragmatism have fueled innovation‚Äîand why Hugging Face‚Äôs library has become the gold standard for model architectures.  

So, whether you‚Äôre here for the PyTorch deep dive or just to witness how someone makes OCR sound exciting, you‚Äôre in the right place. Let‚Äôs get started‚ÄîPablo, the virtual stage is yours!"*  

*(Polite applause, smooth transition to speaker.)*

### **Session Details**  
- **Title:** *PyTorch x Transformers Journey: Pythonicity, Autodiff, and Modularity Defining Modern AI*  
- **Date:** May 7, 2025  
- **Time:** 17:40 - 18:00  
- **Content:**  
  The HuggingFace Transformers library is a flagship example of what makes PyTorch special: a dynamic, readable, and hackable framework that scales from quick experiments to production-ready architectures. It began as an implementation of BERT, continued to a "one model, one file" setup‚Äîideal for iteration‚Äîand grew into a modular codebase now defining 315+ models. Transformers has become a reference implementation for the field: a source of truth for model architectures, behaviors, and pretraining conventions. Its evolution reflects PyTorch‚Äôs own: grounded in Pythonic values, but pragmatic enough to diverge when needed.  

  PyTorch‚Äôs ecosystem has replaced entire toolchains. Scaling models has become simpler: torch.compile brings compiler-level speedups with minimal code changes, and new abstractions like DTensor offer serious performance gains without the low-level complexity.  

  Both PyTorch and Transformers inherit Python‚Äôs spirit‚Äîclarity, flexibility, expressiveness‚Äîwithout being bound by it. PyTorch leans on ATen and C++ kernels under the hood; Transformers increasingly rely on optimized community kernels and hardware-aware implementations from the hub.  

  Modularity and readability didn‚Äôt just improve maintainability‚Äîthey grew the community. Lowering the barrier to entry encourages experimentation, contributions, and faster innovation. This talk tracks that journey‚Äîfrom how PyTorch enabled Transformers, to how the virtuous cycle of design, performance, and pragmatism continues to shape the tools driving modern AI.
