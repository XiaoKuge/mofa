# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, let‚Äôs give a warm welcome to our next speaker‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs not just a cloud-native wizard but also a GitHub 'Pair Extraordinaire' (which, for the uninitiated, is like being named MVP of open-source teamwork). Please welcome **Eitan Yarmush**, Principal Software Engineer at Solo.io!*  

*Eitan spends his days untangling the wild world of service meshes, multi-cluster security, and AI gateways‚Äîbasically, the glue holding modern infrastructure together. When he‚Äôs not debugging distributed systems, he‚Äôs hiking, painting, or being a proud 'doggy dad'‚Äîproving engineers do, in fact, have hobbies.*  

*Today, he‚Äôs here to challenge how we think about AI agents with **'Rethinking the Open Source Agent Stack with Kagent.'** Because let‚Äôs face it: AI agents are *amazing*‚Äîuntil you try to deploy them at scale. Eitan will show us how Kagent brings Kubernetes-native superpowers to the agent world, making them declarative, reliable, and production-ready. Spoiler: It‚Äôs not just another framework.*  

*So, if you‚Äôve ever wanted to ask, *'But how do I actually *run* this thing?'*‚Äîthis is your session. Get ready for demos, insights, and maybe a few 'aha!' moments. Eitan, the virtual stage is yours!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*
