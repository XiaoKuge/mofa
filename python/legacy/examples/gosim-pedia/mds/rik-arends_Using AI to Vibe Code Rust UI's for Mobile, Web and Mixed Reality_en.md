# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:**  
*[With upbeat energy]*  
"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—someone who clearly believes in making UIs *and* career moves that defy gravity. Please welcome Rik Arends, founder of Makepad and the visionary behind Cloud9 IDE—which, by the way, was so good that Amazon decided to keep it forever.  

Rik is a self-taught force of nature, having gone from crafting VJ software for live performances to revolutionizing how we think about UI development with Rust, WebAssembly, and WebGL. If you’ve ever wished you could build blazing-fast, cross-platform interfaces without losing your sanity, Rik is here to show you the light—or rather, the *vibe*.  

Today’s session is titled **‘Using AI to Vibe Code Rust UIs for Mobile, Web, and Mixed Reality’**—because why settle for one platform when you can vibe across all of them? Rik will demo how Makepad Studio and a little AI magic can bring back the joy of Visual Basic… but with Rust’s superpowers. Spoiler: It involves less frustration and more *flow*.  

So get ready to rethink UI development, ask questions, and maybe even pick up a new life mantra: *‘Compile faster, vibe harder.’* Let’s give it up for Rik Arends!"  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*
