# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:**  
*[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Good morning, everyone! It’s a pleasure to have you all here today. Now, if you’ve ever tried using Google Translate and thought, *‘Hmm, that’s… almost right?’*—well, our next speaker has spent his career making sure AI doesn’t just *almost* get it right, but nails multilingual communication at scale.*  

*Please join me in welcoming **Dr. Baosong Yang**, a distinguished scientist at Alibaba’s Tongyi Lab and the brilliant mind behind the Qwen series of models—yes, including the charmingly named Qwen-QwQ. With a Ph.D. in NLP and a portfolio that includes architecting Alibaba’s machine translation system (handling *1.7 billion* translations daily—no pressure, Duolingo), Dr. Yang is at the forefront of making AI truly multilingual.*  

*Today, he’ll take us through **‘Multilingualism of Qwen: From Foundation Model to Applications,’** exploring how we can teach LLMs to not just speak multiple languages but *think* across them—because in a world where language barriers still divide us, AI might just be the polyglot peacekeeper we need.*  

*So, whether you’re here for the tech, the applications, or just to hear how Qwen-QwQ got its name (no promises), you’re in for a fascinating session. Dr. Yang will leave time for questions, so start thinking yours up—and with that, let’s give a warm welcome to Dr. Baosong Yang!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*
