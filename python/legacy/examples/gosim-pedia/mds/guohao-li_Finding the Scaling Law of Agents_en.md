# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

*Our next speaker is someone who doesn’t just think outside the box—he builds entirely new boxes for AI agents to chat inside. Please welcome Dr. Guohao Li, Founder & CEO of Eigent.AI and the brilliant mind behind CAMEL-AI.org. With a PhD from KAUST and a postdoc stint at Oxford, Guohao has been pioneering graph neural networks, multi-agent systems, and—as you’ll soon hear—the art of making AI agents collaborate without drama (unlike some human teams we know).*  

*His work has earned him over 4,900 citations, 10,000 GitHub stars, and a spot at NeurIPS 2023, where he introduced CAMEL: a framework that lets LLM-based agents role-play, cooperate, and maybe even negotiate better than most of us. Today, he’ll unravel the ‘Scaling Law of Agents’—sharing how we can design autonomous systems that don’t just talk, but *work together* at scale. Expect insights, open-source tools, and perhaps a glimpse into the future of AI societies.*  

*So, if you’ve ever wondered how to get AI agents to play nice—or just want to geek out about graph ML—this is your session. Questions are encouraged, and Guohao’s here to dive deep. Let’s give him a warm welcome!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker)*

## Event and Session Details

### Conference Overview
- **Name:** GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates:** May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location:** Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme:** Driving Global Open-Source AI Collaboration  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Six tracks covering AI Model, AI Infra, AI Apps, Embodied AI, AI for Science, and Global Open-Source AI Collaboration.  
  - Hosted by GOSIM (Global Open-Source Innovation Meetup) and co-organized by CSDN.  

### Session Details
- **Title:** Finding the Scaling Law of Agents  
- **Date:** May 7, 2025  
- **Time:** 14:40 - 15:20  
- **Content:**  
  This talk explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named CAMEL. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of a society of agents. In particular, we conduct comprehensive studies on cooperation in multi-agent settings. Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative agents and beyond: [CAMEL-AI GitHub](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel).
