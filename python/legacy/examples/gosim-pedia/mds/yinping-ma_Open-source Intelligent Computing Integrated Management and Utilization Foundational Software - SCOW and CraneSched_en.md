# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

We are thrilled to introduce our next speaker, **Yinping Ma**‚ÄîEngineer at Peking University, Deputy Leader of their Large Model Working Group, and a researcher who‚Äôs probably optimized more computing schedules than most of us have had hot meals.  

With a career dedicated to **high-performance computing (HPC)** and AI infrastructure, Yinping has pioneered open-source tools like **SCOW and CraneSched**‚Äîadopted by dozens of institutions across China‚Äîand contributed to breakthroughs like the *National Key R&D Program*. Fun fact: When she‚Äôs not revolutionizing computing power networks, you might find her work cited in deep-learning papers or keynotes like **GOSIM AI Paris 2025**.  

Today, she‚Äôll dive into *‚ÄòOpen-Source Intelligent Computing Management with SCOW & CraneSched‚Äô*‚Äîa session that‚Äôs equal parts tech brilliance and practical wizardry. Expect insights on how Peking University‚Äôs foundational software is bridging HPC and AI, plus why 56 computing centers are already onboard.  

So, whether you‚Äôre here for the algorithms or the *aha!* moments, get ready to take notes. Let‚Äôs give a warm welcome to **Yinping Ma!**"*
