# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning!*  

We’re in for a treat today with our next speaker—someone who’s not only deeply embedded in the PyTorch ecosystem but also has a knack for making complex things delightfully simple. Please welcome **Nicolas Hug**, Machine Learning Engineer at Meta AI and core contributor to PyTorch’s TorchVision.  

Nicolas is the kind of person who sees a problem—like, say, how to recommend the perfect movie—and thinks, *‘I’ll just build a whole library for that.’* And so he did, creating **Surprise**, the go-to Python tool for recommender systems. When he’s not optimizing TorchVision or contributing to scikit-learn, you might find him climbing mountains or debating the merits of French cheese—because balance is key.  

Today, he’s here to introduce **TorchCodec**, PyTorch’s new media decoding library that turns video and audio into tensors with speed and ease. Whether you're sampling frames or streaming from the cloud, this talk will show you how to handle media like a pro.  

So, get ready for an insightful dive into the future of multimedia in ML. Nicolas, the virtual stage is yours—let’s decode some magic!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*
