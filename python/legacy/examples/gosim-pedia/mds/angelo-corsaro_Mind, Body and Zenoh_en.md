# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## üé§ Host Introduction  
**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
"Good morning, Paris! Get ready for a session that‚Äôs equal parts brainy and boundary-breaking‚Äîbecause our next speaker has literally written the book(s) on how robots should ‚Äòtalk‚Äô to each other. Please welcome **Dr. Angelo Corsaro**, CEO and CTO of ZettaScale Technology, the mastermind behind the **Zenoh protocol**‚Äîwhich, for those of us who still struggle with Wi-Fi passwords, is basically the *universal translator* for cloud-to-robot chatter.  

Angelo isn‚Äôt just a thought leader; he‚Äôs a *doer*. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science, he co-founded ZettaScale, co-chaired the OMG DDS Standard, and now champions **Eclipse Zenoh**‚Äîa protocol so sleek, it‚Äôs like the nervous system for robots. Today, he‚Äôll unpack **‚ÄòMind, Body, and Zenoh‚Äô**‚Äîa talk that answers the *burning* question: *How do we give robots a nervous system?* Spoiler: It‚Äôs not with caffeine. Let‚Äôs give him a warm welcome!"

**Date:** May 6, 2025  
**Time:** 10:30 - 11:10 (CEST)  
**Content:**  
As Robotics and AI evolve, a critical gap has emerged: the absence of an efficient, intelligent "nervous system." This talk introduces **Zenoh**, an Open Source protocol bridging data across clouds, edges, and devices‚Äîenabling seamless communication for autonomous systems. Discover how Zenoh unifies sensing, actuation, and cognition, acting as the *missing link* for intelligent robotics.
