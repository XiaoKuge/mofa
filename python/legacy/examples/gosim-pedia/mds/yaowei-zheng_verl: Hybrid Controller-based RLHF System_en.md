# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Session with Yaowei Zheng

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

*Our next speaker is Yaowei Zheng—a Ph.D. student at Beihang University who clearly decided that 'just' doing groundbreaking AI research wasn’t enough, so he also built **LLaMA Factory**, a toolkit that’s become the Swiss Army knife for fine-tuning large language models. When he’s not unifying 100+ LLMs under one framework, he’s publishing award-winning work on adversarial training and sentiment analysis—because, apparently, sleep is optional when you’re advancing NLP.*  

*Today, he’ll be diving into **verl**, his hybrid controller-based RLHF system—a flexible, production-ready library designed to make large-scale reinforcement learning training smoother than a well-tuned GPT response. Whether you’re into RL, LLMs, or just love efficient systems, you’re in for a treat.*  

*So, get those questions ready—because Yaowei’s insights are as valuable as a high-parameter model. Let’s give him a warm welcome!"*  

*(Pause for applause, transition to speaker.)*
