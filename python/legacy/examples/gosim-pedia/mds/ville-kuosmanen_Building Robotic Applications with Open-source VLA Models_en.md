# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Ville Kuosmanen on Open-Source VLA Robotics

## 🎤 Host Introduction  

*[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—someone who’s making robots a little less ‘clanky’ and a lot more clever. Please welcome Ville Kuosmanen, founder of Voyage Robotics and a pioneer in embodied AI!  

Ville’s journey is as impressive as it is practical. After cutting his teeth in London’s FinTech scene, he decided robots needed better manners—so he founded Voyage Robotics to teach them how to ‘feel’ (literally, with tactile sensors) and interact like humans. His open-source work, like the Voyage Touch library, has earned him awards and a reputation for turning complex problems into elegant, accessible solutions.  

Today, he’s here to demystify the world of open-source Vision-Language-Action models—because why should robots *not* understand both your words and your sarcasm? In this session, you’ll get a hands-on starter guide to building VLA-powered applications in 2025, packed with real-world insights and maybe a few battle scars from the frontier of robotics.  

So, whether you’re here to build the next Rosie the Robot or just curious about the future of AI, get ready for a session that’s equal parts enlightening and actionable. Ville, the stage is yours!"*
