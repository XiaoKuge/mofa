# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning!*  

We’re about to dive into the fascinating world of embodied AI and humanoid robotics—and who better to guide us than someone who’s literally *leaping* ahead in the field? Please join me in welcoming **Min Zhang**, EU Director of Unitree Robotics and the visionary behind some of the most agile—and surprisingly affordable—robots on the planet.  

With a Ph.D. in Computer Science and a career spanning machine translation to cutting-edge robotics, Min has spent the last eight years ensuring that legged robots don’t just walk… they *jump* (over 1.2 meters, to be exact). Under his leadership, Unitree has slashed production costs by 60% while outperforming competitors—proving that advanced robotics doesn’t have to come with a Hollywood budget.  

Today’s session, *‘G1 Open Source Dataset and Humanoid Robot,’* will explore how Unitree is bridging the gap between simulation and real-world AI—with open-source datasets, groundbreaking hardware, and a vision for democratizing robotics. Whether you’re in logistics, healthcare, or just love watching robots backflip, you’re in for a treat.  

So, get those questions ready—because the future of embodied AI is *standing by* (quite literally). Let’s give a warm welcome to **Min Zhang!**"

## 📅 Event and Session Details

### **Conference Overview**  
- **Name**: GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates**: May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location**: Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme**: Driving global open-source AI collaboration across six tracks.  

### **Session Details**  
- **Title**: *G1 Open Source Dataset and Humanoid Robot from Unitree Robotics*  
- **Date**: May 7, 2025  
- **Time**: 11:10 - 11:50  
- **Content**:  
  With artificial intelligence technology advancing rapidly, humanoid robots have become a key form of embodied AI and AGI. Unitree has been developing legged robots for over 8 years and humanoid robots for the past year. The three critical components for realizing AGI are algorithm, data, and computing capability, all of which ultimately run on physical robots. Building robust humanoid robot systems is essential for this ecosystem, and foundation models (World Large-Scale Models) are pivotal for embodied AI in humanoid robots. This session will highlight the most significant progress in the industry and research over the past year and anticipate future advancements.  

  To promote the global embodied AI industry, Unitree is open-sourcing the G1 robot operation dataset, compatible with various open-source solutions and continuously updated.
