# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

**Host:** *[With upbeat energy]*  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

*It‚Äôs my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Garrett Goon‚Äîa Research Scientist at IBM who‚Äôs spent years bridging the gap between theoretical physics and AI, proving that black holes and PyTorch have more in common than you‚Äôd think. With a background that spans from high-energy physics at Cambridge to optimizing distributed ML at IBM, Garrett is the kind of person who makes ‚Äòinterdisciplinary‚Äô look effortless. (And if you‚Äôve ever tried to parallelize a model, you know it‚Äôs anything but.)*  

*Today, he‚Äôll be diving into ‚ÄòAdvancing Mamba in PyTorch‚Äô‚Äîwhere he‚Äôll unpack how IBM is pushing the boundaries of efficient, long-sequence training. Think linear complexity, expert parallelism, and torch-native ops that‚Äôll make your GPU whisper thank you. Whether you‚Äôre here for the physics-grade rigor or the PyTorch wizardry, you‚Äôre in for a treat.*  

*So grab your questions‚Äîthis is one of those talks where you‚Äôll want to take notes. Let‚Äôs give a warm welcome to Garrett Goon!"*  

*(Applause, transition to session.)*

## Event and Session Details

### **Conference Overview**  
- **Name:** GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates:** May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location:** Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme:** *"Driving Global Open-Source AI Collaboration"*  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Six tracks covering AI Model, AI Infra, AI Apps, Embodied AI, AI for Science, and Global Open-Source AI Collaboration.  
  - Hosted by GOSIM (Global Open-Source Innovation Meetup) and co-organized by CSDN.  

### **Session Details**  
- **Title:** *Advancing Mamba in PyTorch*  
- **Date:** May 7, 2025  
- **Time:** 16:00 - 16:20 (CEST)  
- **Content:**  
  *"Mamba layers are efficient alternatives to standard attention: their training complexity is linear in sequence length, while inference is sequence-length-independent and only requires a small cache. I will discuss a selection of IBM's ongoing work in advancing the state of mamba training in PyTorch, including: context-parallel training for long-sequence data, mamba + mixture-of-expert support with expert parallelism, torch-native associative scan ops, and improved DTensor op support."*
