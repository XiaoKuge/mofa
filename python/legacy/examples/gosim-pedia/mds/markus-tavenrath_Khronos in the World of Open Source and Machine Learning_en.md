# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Khronos in the World of Open Source and Machine Learning

## üé§ Host Introduction  
*[With upbeat energy]*  

*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today!*  

It‚Äôs my pleasure to introduce **Markus Tavenrath**, Principal Engineer in Developer Technology at NVIDIA‚Äîwhere he makes GPUs do things most of us didn‚Äôt even know were possible. If you‚Äôve ever used Vulkan-Hpp, you can thank (or blame) Markus‚Äîhe co-founded it, and now 78% of Vulkan developers rely on it. Clearly, he enjoys making life easier for developers‚Ä¶ while also optimizing ray tracing, AI-driven rendering, and chairing the Khronos ML Council.  

Today, Markus will take us on a deep dive into *Khronos in the World of Open Source and Machine Learning*‚Äîwhere open standards meet cutting-edge AI. Expect insights on how Khronos APIs like OpenCL, SYCL, and Vulkan are shaping the future of hardware-accelerated ML.  

So, if you‚Äôre ready to geek out about interoperability, open source, and the future of AI deployment, this is your session. Questions? Save them for after‚Äîor interrupt politely; Markus is famously patient.  

Please join me in welcoming **Markus Tavenrath!**"  

*(Applause, smooth transition to speaker.)*
