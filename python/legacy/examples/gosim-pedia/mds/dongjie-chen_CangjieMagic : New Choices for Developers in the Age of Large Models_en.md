# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Session Details

## Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning! It’s a pleasure to welcome you to what promises to be a fascinating session. Our next speaker is Dong Chen, a Senior Software Engineer at Huawei who’s clearly mastered the art of making machines smarter—while the rest of us still struggle with our smart coffee makers.  

With a Ph.D. in Computer Science and a career spanning academia and cutting-edge industry R&D, Dong has been at the forefront of program analysis, autonomous systems, and now, the thrilling world of large-model AI. His work has earned him accolades like Huawei’s Innovation Award and a Best Paper nod from IEEE—proof that he not only speaks code but writes it elegantly enough to impress even peer reviewers.  

Today, he’ll dive into *‘CangjieMagic: New Choices for Developers in the Age of Large Models’*—a session that’s less about ancient Chinese script and more about how AI agents are rewriting the rules of development. Expect insights on Huawei’s Agent DSL framework, smart task planning, and why the future of HarmonyOS apps might just involve fewer headaches and more ‘aha!’ moments.  

So, whether you’re here to geek out over modular invocation or just love a good paradigm shift, Dong’s got you covered. Please join me in giving him a warm welcome—and don’t forget those questions; this is one brain you’ll want to pick!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*

### Session Details
- **Title:** CangjieMagic: New Choices for Developers in the Age of Large Models  
- **Date:** May 6, 2025  
- **Time:** 11:10 - 11:50  
- **Content:**  
  With the surge in popularity of various AI large models, the trend of agent-oriented development in large model applications has become increasingly evident. Agents are gradually becoming a core element in the development of large model applications. This topic shares an AI large model Agent development framework based on the Cangjie programming language. This framework supports Agent-oriented programming, providing developers with an efficient Agent DSL for Agent programming. Its main features include: support for the MCP protocol to facilitate mutual invocation between Agents and tools, support for modular invocation, and support for intelligent task planning. It enhances the efficiency of developers in creating smart HarmonyOS applications, delivers an exceptional development experience, and explores new paradigms for future large model application development.
