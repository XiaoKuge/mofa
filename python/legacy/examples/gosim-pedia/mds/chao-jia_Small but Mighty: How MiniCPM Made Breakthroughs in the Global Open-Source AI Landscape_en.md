# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, if you've ever wished your AI could do more with less—today's speaker is about to make your day. Please join me in welcoming Chao Jia, Founding Partner at OpenBMB and ModelBest, and the mastermind behind the 'Little Steel Cannon' of AI models. (Yes, that's the actual nickname for MiniCPM—proof that even algorithms can have personality.)*  

*With a background from UT Austin and a track record of making small models outperform their bulkier cousins, Chao has turned open-source AI into a global conversation. Under his leadership, MiniCPM has racked up 26,000 GitHub stars and 7 million downloads—because who doesn't love an underdog story where the underdog is, well, code?*  

*This afternoon, he'll reveal how MiniCPM punches above its weight class in the open-source arena. Expect insights on democratizing AI, why smaller can be smarter, and maybe a few surprises—because when your model's nickname sounds like a superhero, the session's bound to be lively.*  

*Chao's graciously saved time for your burning questions, so don't be shy. Let's give a warm welcome to the architect of efficient AI revolutions—Chao Jia!"*
