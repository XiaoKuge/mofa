# GOSIM AI Paris 2025: Spatial Reasoning LLMs with Huy Hoang Ha

## 🎤 Host Introduction  
*[With upbeat energy]*  

**"Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a warm welcome to our next speaker—someone who proves that brilliance comes in unexpected combinations. By day, he’s an LLM researcher pushing the boundaries of AI; by training, he’s a pharmacist. (Because if you can’t cure a cold, why not cure *data inefficiency* instead?)**

**Please welcome Huy Hoang Ha**, LLM Researcher at Menlo Research and the mind behind groundbreaking work like *Ichigo*—a real-time voice assistant that fuses speech and text seamlessly—and *Pensez*, a bilingual reasoning model that thrives on minimal data. (Take *that*, big-data dogma.)  

Today, he’ll take us on a journey through **spatial reasoning in LLMs**, where robots don’t just *think* but *navigate*—whether it’s solving mazes, manipulating objects, or interpreting 3D space. Expect insights on projects like AlphaMaze and AlphaVoxel, and why teaching AI ‘left from right’ might just revolutionize robotics.  

*Questions encouraged! Let’s dive in—please join me in welcoming **Huy Hoang Ha**."*  

*(Applause)*
