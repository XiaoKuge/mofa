# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## üé§ Host Introduction

**Host:**  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, let‚Äôs give a warm welcome to our next speaker‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs clearly mastered the art of making AI behave itself. Please welcome R√©milouf, Co-Founder and CEO of DotTXT, and the brains behind *Outlines*, the open-source framework that‚Äôs putting LLMs on a leash‚Äîfiguratively, of course.*  

*With a background that spans Bayesian statistics, generative modeling, and even early days at Twitter, R√©milouf has spent years bridging the gap between theory and real-world AI applications. Now, at DotTXT, he‚Äôs tackling one of the most frustrating challenges in AI today: getting models to actually follow instructions. (Because, let‚Äôs be honest, we‚Äôve all had that moment of staring at a JSON output wondering‚Ä¶ *why?*).*  

*Today, he‚Äôll show us how *Outlines* brings order to the chaos of LLM generation‚Äîturning unpredictable outputs into perfectly structured results. If you‚Äôve ever wasted hours debugging parsing errors or wrestling with prompts, this session is your antidote. Get ready to learn how to make AI *reliably* do what you ask‚Äîno bribes or begging required.*  

*Please join me in welcoming R√©milouf‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive into the world of constrained generation!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*

## üìÖ Event and Session Details  

### **Conference Overview**  
- **Name:** GOSIM AI Paris 2025  
- **Dates:** May 6-7, 2025  
- **Location:** Station F, Paris, France  
- **Theme:** *Global Open-Source AI Collaboration*  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Six tracks covering AI Model, AI Infra, AI Apps, Embodied AI, AI for Science, and Global Open-Source AI Collaboration.  
  - Hosted by GOSIM (Global Open-Source Innovation Meetup) and co-organized by CSDN.  

### **Session Details**  
- **Title:** *LLM Constrained Generation in PyTorch with Outlines*  
- **Date:** May 7, 2025  
- **Time:** 16:40 - 17:00  
- **Content:**  
  *Parsing errors, unexpected outputs. If you've felt the frustration of trying to wrangle LLMs into producing consistently formatted results, you've likely built complex post-processing pipelines and elaborate prompting schemes. What if there was a way to guarantee structured outputs without these workarounds? Enter structured outputs.*  

  *In this talk, we'll explore how model outputs can be precisely constrained using formal specifications (e.g. JSON Schema), why this dramatically improves reliability, and how it reduces sensitivity to prompt engineering. We'll demonstrate advanced use cases using our open-source library Outlines, which add structured outputs to the `transformers`, `vllm`, etc inference libraries.*  

  *By the end of the session, you'll understand how to implement these techniques in your applications today, enabling your models to generate flawless JSON with minimal latency overhead compared to unconstrained generation.*
