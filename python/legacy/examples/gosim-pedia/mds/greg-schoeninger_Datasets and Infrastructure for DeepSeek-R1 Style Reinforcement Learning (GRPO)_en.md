# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## 🎤 Host Introduction  
*[With upbeat energy]*  

*"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us for what promises to be a fascinating session!*  

*Our next speaker is Greg Schoeninger—CEO of Oxen.ai, AI innovator, and, as some of you may know, a proud digital nomad who occasionally codes from his camper van with his trusty dog by his side. (Talk about work-life balance!) Greg has spent over a decade in AI/ML, from IBM to Disney, and now leads Oxen.ai, where he’s making AI research more accessible through open-source tools and his popular ‘Arxiv Dives’ series.*  

*Today, he’s here to take us deep into the world of reinforcement learning for LLMs—specifically, the datasets and infrastructure behind DeepSeek-R1. Ever wanted to train your own reasoning LLM that can write code locally? Well, Greg’s going to walk us through exactly how to do that, from theory to practical implementation. We’re in for a seriously insightful session, so get your questions ready—this is one you won’t want to miss!*  

*Please join me in welcoming Greg Schoeninger!"*  

*(Applause, transition to speaker.)*
