# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## üé§ Host Introduction  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, good [morning/afternoon]! It‚Äôs a pleasure to welcome you to what promises to be a fascinating session. Our next speaker is someone who doesn‚Äôt just talk about AI‚Äîhe makes it scale, optimize, and, frankly, behave itself in production. Please welcome Erwan Gallen, Senior Principal Product Manager for Generative AI at Red Hat!  

Erwan is a seasoned expert in open-source AI and cloud-native tech, with a track record of turning complex systems into scalable solutions. From leading OpenShift AI initiatives to demystifying multi-accelerator deployments, he‚Äôs the kind of person who makes LLMs run faster while the rest of us are still waiting for our coffee to brew.  

Today, he‚Äôll dive into *Scaling LLM Inference with vLLM*‚Äîa topic hotter than a GPU under full load. You‚Äôll learn how vLLM became the go-to engine for low-latency inference, how to wrangle multi-accelerator setups, and the art of quantization without sacrificing model IQ. Spoiler: It involves data from *half a million* evaluations. So, if you‚Äôve ever wondered how to serve LLMs at scale without your infrastructure crying for mercy, this is your session.  

Feel free to ask questions‚Äîbecause if there‚Äôs one thing Erwan loves more than open source, it‚Äôs a good challenge. Let‚Äôs give him a warm welcome!"*

### üéôÔ∏è **Session Details**  
- **Title:** *Scaling LLM Inference with vLLM: Multi-Accelerator Serving and Quantized LLMs*  
- **Date:** May 7, 2025  
- **Time:** 11:30 - 11:50  
- **Content:**  
  vLLM has become the community-standard engine for low-latency LLM inference, achieving a 10√ó increase in usage in 2024 and surpassing 100,000 daily installs by January 2025. Supported by hundreds of contributors and productized through Red Hat AI, vLLM provides a vendor-neutral solution for serving cutting-edge models at scale. This talk outlines a practical blueprint for scaling LLM inference using vLLM, integrating both system-level techniques and model-level optimizations.  

  We begin by addressing the challenges of deploying LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning in production. Leveraging vLLM‚Äôs engine architecture, multi-accelerator deployments using tensor parallelism, paged attention scheduling, and prefill‚Äìdecode disaggregation demonstrate how a single node can efficiently drive multiple AI accelerators, enhancing throughput without compromising latency.  

  The second optimization layer focuses on quantization. Based on over 500,000 evaluations across language and vision-language models, we examine the accuracy‚Äìspeed trade-offs of weight and activation quantization. We introduce new pathways that significantly reduce memory usage while maintaining model quality. Attendees will leave with data-driven insights and ready-to-use configurations for deploying state-of-the-art quantized models in scalable enterprise inference pipelines.
