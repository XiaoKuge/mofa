# GOSIM AI Paris 2025

## Host Introduction

*"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning!*  

We’re about to dive into a session that’s all about the power of collaboration in AI—because let’s face it, even geniuses need a team.  

Please join me in welcoming **Guang Liu**, Technical Lead of the Data Research Team at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI). Guang is the brains behind the **OpenSeek project** and the **Aquila LLM series**—because why settle for one groundbreaking project when you can architect two? With a PhD in tow and stints at Ping An Life Insurance and BAAI, he’s spent years turning theoretical AI into real-world solutions, from stock predictions to multilingual models like AltCLIP.  

Today, he’ll unpack **‘OpenSeek: Collaborative Innovation for Next-Gen Models’**—a vision to unite the open-source community in building models that go beyond DeepSeek. Expect insights on algorithms, data systems, and why the future of AI is a team sport.  

So, grab your questions—this is your chance to learn from someone who’s not just talking about the next generation but actively building it.  

Let’s give a warm welcome to **Guang Liu!**"*
